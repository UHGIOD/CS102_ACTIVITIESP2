"1","The Architecture of Sponge Choanocyte Chambers Maximizes Mechanical Pumping Efficiency","Takumi Ogawa, Shuji Koyama, Toshihiro Omori, Kenji Kikuchi, Helene de Maleprade, Raymond E. Goldstein, Takuji Ishikawa","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Sponges, the basalmost members of the animal kingdom, exhibit a range of complex architectures in which microfluidic channels connect multitudes of spherical chambers lined with choanocytes, flagellated filter-feeding cells. Choanocyte chambers can possess scores or even hundreds of such cells, which drive complex flows entering through porous walls and exiting into the sponge channels. One of the mysteries of the choanocyte chamber is its spherical shape, as it seems inappropriate for inducing directional transport since many choanocyte flagella beat in opposition to such a flow. Here we combine direct imaging of choanocyte chambers in living sponges with computational studies of many-flagella models to understand the connection between chamber architecture and directional flow. We find that those flagella that beat against the flow play a key role in raising the pressure inside the choanocyte chamber, with the result that the mechanical pumping efficiency, calculated from the pressure rise and flow rate, reaches a maximum at a small outlet opening angle. Comparison between experimental observations and the results of numerical simulations reveal that the chamber diameter, flagellar wave number and the outlet opening angle of the freshwater sponge $E. muelleri$, as well as several other species, are related in a manner that maximizes the mechanical pumping efficiency. These results indicate the subtle balances at play during morphogenesis of choanocyte chambers, and give insights into the physiology and body design of sponges.","Thu, 22 Feb 2024 08:05:05 UTC (5,462 KB)"
"2","Fractal scaling and the aesthetics of trees","Jingyi Gao, Mitchell Newberry","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Trees in works of art have stirred emotions in viewers for millennia. Leonardo da Vinci described geometric proportions in trees to provide both guidelines for painting and insights into tree form and function. Da Vinci's Rule of trees further implies fractal branching with a particular scaling exponent $\alpha = 2$ governing both proportions between the diameters of adjoining boughs and the number of boughs of a given diameter. Contemporary biology increasingly supports an analogous rule with $\alpha = 3$ known as Murray's Law. Here we relate trees in art to a theory of proportion inspired by both da Vinci and modern tree physiology. We measure $\alpha$ in 16th century Islamic architecture, Edo period Japanese painting and 20th century European art, finding $\alpha$ in the range 1.5 to 2.5. We find that both conformity and deviations from ideal branching create stylistic effect and accommodate constraints on design and implementation. Finally, we analyze an abstract tree by Piet Mondrian which forgoes explicit branching but accurately captures the modern scaling exponent $\alpha = 3$, anticipating Murray's Law by 15 years. This perspective extends classical mathematical, biological and artistic ways to understand, recreate and appreciate the beauty of trees.","Wed, 21 Feb 2024 04:09:25 UTC (7,792 KB)"
"3","An SEIR network epidemic model with manual and digital contact tracing allowing delays","Dongni Zhang, Tom Britton","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","We consider an SEIR epidemic model on a network also allowing random contacts, where recovered individuals could either recover naturally or be diagnosed. Upon diagnosis, manual contact tracing is triggered such that each infected network contact is reported, tested and isolated with some probability and after a random delay. Additionally, digital tracing (based on a tracing app) is triggered if the diagnosed individual is an app-user, and then all of its app-using infectees are immediately notified and isolated. The early phase of the epidemic with manual and/or digital tracing is approximated by different multi-type branching processes, and three respective reproduction numbers are derived. The effectiveness of both contact tracing mechanisms is numerically quantified through the reduction of the reproduction number. This shows that app-using fraction plays an essential role in the overall effectiveness of contact tracing. The relative effectiveness of manual tracing compared to digital tracing increases if: more of the transmission occurs on the network, when the tracing delay is shortened, and when the network degree distribution is heavy-tailed. For realistic values, the combined tracing case can reduce $R_0$ by $20-30\%$, so other preventive measures are needed to reduce the reproduction number down to $1.2-1.4$ for contact tracing to make it successful in avoiding big outbreaks.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 21:45:00 UTC (641 KB)"
"4","Visual acuity and contrast sensitivity under monochromatic yellow light","Elisabetta Baldanzi, Paolo Antonino Grasso, Clara Gori, Massimo Gurioli, Federcio Tommasi, Alessandro Farini","Quantitative Methods (q-bio.QM)","This study investigates the impact of monochromatic lighting on visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS). Traditional assessments of VA and CS are typically conducted under the illumination of ``white'' light, but variations in color temperature can influence outcomes. Utilizing data from an exhibition by Olafur Eliasson, where a room was illuminated with low-pressure sodium lamps, creating an almost monochromatic yellow light, we compared visual assessments in the yellow room with conventional lighting in a white room. For VA, the results show no significant differences between the two lighting conditions, while for CS, a more nuanced situation is observed. The bias in CS measurements is clinically relevant, and the p-value suggests that further investigation with a larger, more diverse sample may be worthwhile. Despite limitations, such as higher illumination conditions than standard protocols, the unique ``laboratory'' offered by the exhibition facilitated measurements not easily achievable in a traditional setting.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 12:25:08 UTC (1,621 KB)"
"5","Criticality in the Luria-Delbrück model with an arbitrary mutation rate","Deng Pan, Jie Lin, Ariel Amir","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","The Luria-Delbrück model is a classic model of population dynamics with random mutations, that has been used historically to prove that random mutations drive evolution. In typical scenarios, the relevant mutation rate is exceedingly small, and mutants are counted only at the final time point. Here, inspired by recent experiments on DNA repair, we study a mathematical model that is formally equivalent to the Luria-Delbrück setup, with the repair rate $p$ playing the role of mutation rate, albeit taking on large values, of order unity per cell division. We find that although at large times the fraction of repaired cells approaches one, the variance of the number of repaired cells undergoes a phase transition: when $p>1/2$ the variance decreases with time, but, intriguingly, for $p<1/2$ even though the fraction of repaired cells approaches 1, the variance in number of repaired cells increases with time. Analyzing DNA-repair experiments, we find that in order to explain the data the model should also take into account the probability of a successful repair process once it is initiated. Taken together, our work shows how the study of variability can lead to surprising phase-transitions as well as provide biological insights into the process of DNA-repair.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 19:35:40 UTC (3,556 KB)"
"6","Magnetic Nanoparticles for Neural Engineering","Gerardo F. Goya, Vittoria Raffa","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are the foundation of several new strategies for neural repair and neurological therapies. The fact that a remote force can act on MNPs at the cytoplasmic space constitutes the essence of many new neurotherapeutic concepts. MNPs with a predesigned physicochemical characteristic can interact with external magnetic fields to apply mechanical forces in definite areas of the cell to modulate cellular behaviour. Magnetic actuation to direct the outgrowth on neurons after nerve injury has already demonstrated the therapeutic potential for neural repair. When these magnetic cores are functionalized with molecules such as nerve growth factors or neuroprotective molecules, multifunctional devices can be developed. This chapter will review some of these new nanotechnology-based solutions for neurological diseases, specifically those based on the use of engineered MNPs used for neuroprotection and neuroregeneration. These include the use of MNPs as magnetic actuators to guide neural cells, modulate intracellular transport and stimulate axonal growth after nerve injury.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 08:38:41 UTC (3,836 KB)"
"7","Interferometry with few photons","Q. Pears Stefano, A. G. Magnoni, D. Rodrigues, J. Tiffenberg, C. Iemmi","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Optical phase determination is an important and established tool in diverse fields such as astronomy, biology, or quantum optics. There is increasing interest in using a lower number of total photons. However, different noise sources, such as electronic readout noise in the detector, and shot noise, hamper the phase estimation in regimes of very low illumination. Here we report a study on how the quality of phase determination is affected by these two sources of noise. To that end, we experimentally reconstruct different wavefronts by means of a point diffraction interferometer for different mean intensities of illumination, up to $15\ \mathrm{phot/px}$. Our interferometer features a Skipper-CCD sensor, which allows us to reduce the readout noise arbitrarily, thus enabling us to separate the effect of these two sources of noise. For two cases of interest: a spatial qudit encoding phase, consisting of d = 6 uniform phase regions, and a more general continuous phase, we see that reducing the readout noise leads to a clear improvement in the quality of reconstruction. This can be explained by a simple noise model that allows us to predict the expected fidelity of reconstruction and shows excellent agreement with the measurements.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 17:21:06 UTC (573 KB)"

Computational methods, including Finite Element (FE) Models, have emerged as valuable tools for investigating the causes and treatment of ASD through biomechanical simulations. However, the process of generating personalized FE models is often complex and time-consuming. To address this challenge, we present a repository of FE models with diverse spine morphologies that statistically represent real geometries from a cohort of patients. These models are generated using EOS images, which are utilized to reconstruct 3D surface spine models. Subsequently, a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) is constructed, enabling the adaptation of a FE hexahedral mesh template for both the bone and soft tissues of the spine through mesh morphing. The SSM deformation fields facilitate the personalization of the mean hexahedral FE model based on sagittal balance measurements. Ultimately, this new hexahedral SSM tool offers a means to generate a virtual cohort of 16807 thoracolumbar FE spine models, which are openly shared in a public repository.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 14:29:37 UTC (1,367 KB)"
"9","Sedimentation dynamics of triply-twisted Möbius bands: Geometry versus topology","Nicolas Moreno, David Vazquez-Cortes, Eliot Fried","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","Chiral objects have intrigued scientists across several disciplines, including mathematics, crystallography, chemistry, and biology. A Möbius band, an emblematic chiral structure, can be made by connecting the ends of a strip after applying an odd number of twists. Traditionally, the direction of the twist governs its rotational behaviour during sedimentation in a fluid. Here, we present experimental and computational investigations of triply-twisted Möbius bands boasting threefold rotational symmetry that challenge this prevailing understanding. We explore three types of bands with different curvatures, each defined by its construction method. Experimental observations reveal that all three types of bands align axially and exhibit rotational motion during sedimentation. Surprisingly, for only one type of band the spinning direction (chiral hydrodynamic response) departs from expectations; it is not solely determined by the twist direction but changes with the aspect ratio of the band. Numerical simulations corroborate this observation, and an in-depth analysis of the resistance tensors of each type of band sheds light on the possible causes of this transition. We propose that modifications in fluid-induced drag, combined with inertial effects, underpin this phenomenon. Our study challenges existing knowledge of chiral object hydrodynamics, enriching our understanding of complex fluid dynamics. Moreover, it offers transformative potential across diverse fields, promising advancements in mixing, separation processes, and innovative passive swimmers.","Tue, 20 Feb 2024 13:59:40 UTC (10,147 KB)"
"10","Field-extension statistics of charged semiflexible polymers stretched with uniform electric fields","Ananya Mondal, Greg Morrison","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Single-molecule force-extension experiments have allowed quantitative measurements of the mechanical responses of biomolecules to applied forces explaining their roles in key biological functions. Electrophoretic stretching of charged polymers such as DNA in uniform electric fields is one such example, currently, used for sequencing purposes. Field-extension statistics of charged polymers differ from laser optical tweezer setups due to a non-uniform tension along the backbone of the chain, the effects of which remain poorly understood. In this paper, we modify an existing analytically tractable mean-field (MF) approach to account for the heterogeneity in tension for electric fields. Naively using this model for stretching of charged polymers such as DNA under electric fields results in local overstretching of the chain and gives inaccurate field-extension statistics. We improve this approach and account for the inhomogeneity in the tension by subdividing the chain into smaller segments while imposing the inextensibility of the chain. We find that the subdivided MF model shows better agreement with the simulations for the force-extension plots. We also show that using an isotropic mean-field model overestimates the longitudinal fluctuations both for tension forces as well as for fields. We correct the quantitative predictions for the fluctuations in the mean extension by numerically differentiating the field-extension plots. We also find that the subdivided MF model can accurately predict the statistics of experimentally relevant quantities, such as transverse fluctuations, due to the analytical tractability of the model. These field-extension predictions may be further used to introduce confinement effects in the subdivided MF model and develop a comprehensive understanding of sequencing technologies.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 19:17:30 UTC (5,288 KB)"

Since the dynamic consequences of the string release may disturb the archer's postural equilibrium, they should have integrated them in their motor program to optimize postural stability. This study aimed to characterize the postural strategy archers use to limit the potentially detrimental impact of the bow release on their postural stability and identify characteristics that may explain a better performance. Six elite and seven sub-elite archers performed a series of 18 shots at 70 meters, standing on two force plates. Postural stability indicators were computed during the aiming and the shooting phase using the trajectory of the center of pressure. Two postural strategies were defined, as whether they were triggered before (early) or after (late) the string release time. Both groups used anticipated postural adjustments, but elite archers triggered them before the string release more often and sooner. Scores differed between the two groups, but no differences were found between early and late shots. Trained archers seem to have finely integrated the dynamic consequences of their bow motion, triggering anticipated postural adjustments prior to the string release. However, it remains unclear whether this anticipation can positively influence the performance outcome.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 09:22:45 UTC (717 KB)"
"12","A novel molecule generative model of VAE combined with Transformer","Yasuhiro Yoshikai, Tadahaya Mizuno, Shumpei Nemoto, Hiroyuki Kusuhara","Biomolecules (q-bio.BM)","Recently, molecule generation using deep learning has been actively investigated in drug discovery. In this field, Transformer and VAE are widely used as powerful models, but they are rarely used in combination due to structural and performance mismatch of them. This study proposes a model that combines these two models through structural and parameter optimization in handling diverse molecules. The proposed model shows comparable performance to existing models in generating molecules, and showed by far superior performance in generating molecules with unseen structures. In addition, the proposed model successfully predicted molecular properties using the latent representation of VAE. Ablation studies suggested the advantage of VAE over other generative models like language model in generating novel molecules, and that the molecules can be described by ~32 dimensional variables, much smaller than existing descriptors and models. This study is expected to provide a virtual chemical library containing a wide variety of compounds for virtual screening and to enable efficient screening.","Mon, 19 Feb 2024 08:46:04 UTC (874 KB)"

While deep learning has shown promise, existing methods often depend on holo-protein structures (docked, and not accessible in realistic tasks) or neglect pocket sidechain conformations, leading to limited practical utility and unrealistic conformation predictions. To fill these gaps, we introduce an under-explored task, named flexible docking to predict poses of ligand and pocket sidechains simultaneously and introduce Re-Dock, a novel diffusion bridge generative model extended to geometric manifolds. Specifically, we propose energy-to-geometry mapping inspired by the Newton-Euler equation to co-model the binding energy and conformations for reflecting the energy-constrained docking generative process. Comprehensive experiments on designed benchmark datasets including apo-dock and cross-dock demonstrate our model's superior effectiveness and efficiency over current methods.","Sun, 18 Feb 2024 05:04:50 UTC (8,401 KB)[v2] Wed, 21 Feb 2024 07:46:07 UTC (8,401 KB)"
"14","Extended generalized recurrence plot quantification of complex circular patterns","Maik Riedl, Norbert Marwan, Jürgen Kurths","Pattern Formation and Solitons (nlin.PS)","The generalized recurrence plot is a modern tool for quantification of complex spatial patterns. Its application spans the analysis of trabecular bone structures, Turing patterns, turbulent spatial plankton patterns, and fractals. Determinism is a central measure in this framework quantifying the level of regularity of spatial structures. We show by basic examples of fully regular patterns of different symmetries that this measure underestimates the orderliness of circular patterns resulting from rotational symmetries. We overcome this crucial problem by checking additional structural elements of the generalized recurrence plot which is demonstrated with the examples. Furthermore, we show the potential of the extended quantity of determinism applying it to more irregular circular patterns which are generated by the complex Ginzburg-Landau-equation and which can be often observed in real spatially extended dynamical systems. So, we are able to reconstruct the main separations of the system's parameter space analyzing single snapshots of the real part only, in contrast to the use of the original quantity. This ability of the proposed method promises also an improved description of other systems with complicated spatio-temporal dynamics typically occurring in fluid dynamics, climatology, biology, ecology, social sciences, etc.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 12:18:42 UTC (4,586 KB)"

Genetics are influenced by the environment, specifically the social experience during the critical neurodevelopmental period. Despite efficacy of early behavior interventions targeted specific behaviors in some autistic children, there is no sustainable treatment for the two core symptoms: deficits in social interaction and communication, and stereotyped or restrained behaviors or interests. In this study, we investigated the impact of the social environment on both wild-type (WT) and Shank3 knockout (KO) mice, a mouse model that reproduces core autism-like symptoms. Our findings revealed that WT mice raised in an enriched social environment maintained social interest towards new conspecifics across multiple trials. Additionally, we observed that 2 hours or chronic social isolation induced social deficits or enhanced social interaction and olfactory neuron responses in WT animals, respectively. Notably, chronic social isolation restored both social novelty and olfactory deficits, and normalized self-grooming behavior in Shank3 KO mice. These results novel insights for the implementation of behavioral intervention and inclusive classrooms programs for children with ASD.","Wed, 29 Nov 2023 16:46:15 UTC (34,454 KB)"
"16","A general mechanism for enhancer-insulator pairing reveals heterogeneous dynamics in long-distant 3D gene regulation","Lucas Hedström, Ralf Metzler, Ludvig Lizana","Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)","Cells regulate fates and complex body plans using spatiotemporal signaling cascades that alter gene expression. Enhancers, short DNA sequences (50-150 base pairs), help coordinate these cascades by attracting regulatory proteins to enhance the transcription of distal genes by binding to promoters. In humans, there are hundreds of thousands of enhancers dispersed across the genome, which poses a challenging coordination task to prevent unintended gene activation. To mitigate this problem, the genome contains additional DNA elements, insulators, that block enhancer-promoter interactions. However, there is an open problem with how the insulation works, especially as enhancer-insulator pairs may be separated by millions of base pairs. Based on recent empirical data from Hi-C experiments, this paper proposes a new mechanism that challenges the common paradigm that rests on specific insulator-insulator interactions. Instead, this paper introduces a stochastic looping model where enhancers bind weakly to surrounding chromatin. After calibrating the model to experimental data, we use simulations to study the broad distribution of hitting times between an enhancer and a promoter when there are blocking insulators. In some cases, there is a large difference between average and most probable hitting times, making it difficult to assign a typical time scale, hinting at highly defocused regulation times. We also map our computational model onto a resetting problem that allows us to derive several analytical results. Besides offering new insights into enhancer-insulator interactions, our paper advances the understanding of gene regulatory networks and causal connections between genome folding and gene activation.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 14:43:59 UTC (301 KB)"

Their diversity throughout the Phanerozoic shows periodic fluctuations. We identify a possible abiotic candidate for driving these patterns which seems to potentially influence radiolarian diversity changes during this period at a significance level of $\sim 2.2 \sigma$. Our finding suggests a significant correlation between the origination of new radiolaria species and maximum excursions of the Solar system from the Galactic plane, where the magnetic shielding of cosmic rays is expected to be weaker. We connect the particularly strong radiolaria blooming during the Middle Triassic to the so-called Mesozoic dipole-low of the geomagnetic field, which was in its deepest state when radiolarias were blooming. According to the scenario, high-energy cosmic rays presumably implied particular damage to the DNA during the maximum excursions which may trigger large chromosomal abnormalities leading to the appearance of a large number of new genera and species during these periods.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 13:27:31 UTC (9,825 KB)"

Through activity-driven temporal networks, we formulate a general framework which models a wide range of adaptive behaviours and mitigation strategies, observed in real populations. We analytically derive the conditions for a widespread diffusion of epidemics in the presence of arbitrary adaptive behaviours, highlighting the crucial role of correlations between agents behaviour in the infected and in the susceptible state. We focus on the effects of sick-leave, comparing the effectiveness of different strategies in reducing the impact of the epidemic and preserving the system operativeness. We show the critical relevance of heterogeneity in individual behavior: in homogeneous networks, all sick-leave strategies are equivalent and poorly effective, while in heterogeneous networks, strategies targeting the most vulnerable nodes are able to effectively mitigate the epidemic, also avoiding a deterioration in system activity and maintaining a low level of absenteeism. Interestingly, with targeted strategies both the minimum of population activity and the maximum of absenteeism anticipate the infection peak, which is effectively flattened and delayed, so that full operativeness is almost restored when the infection peak arrives. We also provide realistic estimates of the model parameters for influenza-like illness, thereby suggesting strategies for managing epidemics and absenteeism in realistic populations.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 10:39:16 UTC (980 KB)"
"19","Using quantum annealing to design lattice proteins","Anders Irbäck, Lucas Knuthson, Sandipan Mohanty, Carsten Peterson","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Quantum annealing has shown promise for finding solutions to difficult optimization problems, including protein folding. Recently, we used the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer to explore the folding problem in a coarse-grained lattice model, the HP model, in which amino acids are classified into two broad groups: hydrophobic (H) and polar (P). Using a set of 22 HP sequences with up to 64 amino acids, we demonstrated the fast and consistent identification of the correct HP model ground states using the D-Wave hybrid quantum-classical solver. An equally relevant biophysical challenge, called the protein design problem, is the inverse of the above, where the task is to predict protein sequences that fold to a given structure. Here, we approach the design problem by a two-step procedure, implemented and executed on a D-Wave machine. In the first step, we perform a pure sequence-space search by varying the type of amino acid at each sequence position, and seek sequences which minimize the HP-model energy of the target structure. After mapping this task onto an Ising spin glass representation, we employ a hybrid quantum-classical solver to deliver energy-optimal sequences for structures with 30-64 amino acids, with a 100% success rate. In the second step, we filter the optimized sequences from the first step according to their ability to fold to the intended structure. In addition, we try solving the sequence optimization problem using only the QPU, which confines us to sizes $\le$20, due to exponentially decreasing success rates. To shed light on the pure QPU results, we investigate the effects of control errors caused by an imperfect implementation of the intended Hamiltonian on the QPU, by numerically analyzing the Schrödinger equation. We find that the simulated success rates in the presence of control noise semi-quantitatively reproduce the modest pure QPU results for larger chains.","Wed, 14 Feb 2024 10:28:43 UTC (83 KB)"

In several key situations, the depth-averaged fluid flow is accurately captured by the solution of an associated Brinkman equation whose screening length is proportional to the depth of the fluid layer.

The model, inspired by real-world ecological crises like the decline of amphibian populations due to chytridiomycosis and sea star populations due to Sea Star Wasting Disease, aims to understand the conditions under which a sink host population can present ecological rescue from a healthier, source population. Mathematical and numerical analyses reveal the critical roles of the basic reproductive numbers of the source and sink populations, the maturation rate, and the dispersal rate of juveniles in determining population outcomes. The study identifies conditions for disease-free, endemic, and extinction equilibria in sink populations, emphasizing the potential for ecological and evolutionary mechanisms to facilitate coexistence or recovery. These findings provide insights into managing natural populations affected by disease, with implications for conservation strategies, such as the importance of maintaining reproductively viable refuge populations and considering the effects of dispersal and maturation rates on population recovery. The research underscores the complexity of host-pathogen dynamics in spatially structured environments and highlights the need for multi-faceted approaches to biodiversity conservation in the face of emerging diseases.","Fri, 9 Feb 2024 20:51:15 UTC (1,036 KB)"

The goal was to determine whether auxiliary data alone could predict the reported behavior. Different spatial and temporal extents and temporal resolutions were considered. Accuracy scores averaged 88% for monthly predictions at single water bodies and 86% for spatial predictions on a day in a specific region across Canada. At other resolutions and scales, the models only achieved low prediction accuracy of around 60%. The study represents a first attempt at predicting angler behavior in time and space at a large scale and establishes a foundation for potential future expansions in various directions.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 19:56:35 UTC (1,905 KB)"
"26","Microscopic models for the large-scale spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus: A Statistical Mechanics approach","Marzia Bisi, Silvia Lorenzani","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","In this work, we derive a system of Boltzmann-type equations to describe the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus at the microscopic scale, that is by modeling the human-to-human mechanisms of transmission. To this end, we consider two populations, characterized by specific distribution functions, made up of individuals without symptoms (population $1$) and infected people with symptoms (population $2$). The Boltzmann operators model the interactions between individuals within the same population and among different populations with a probability of transition from one to the other due to contagion or, vice versa, to recovery. In addition, the influence of innate and adaptive immune systems is taken into account. Then, starting from the Boltzmann microscopic description we derive a set of evolution equations for the size and mean state of each population considered. Mathematical properties of such macroscopic equations, as equilibria and their stability, are investigated and some numerical simulations are performed in order to analyze the ability of our model to reproduce the characteristic features of Covid-19.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 17:06:17 UTC (152 KB)"

Ramasco","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","When considering airborne epidemic spreading in social systems, a natural connection arises between mobility and epidemic contacts. As individuals travel, possibilities to encounter new people either at the final destination or during the transportation process appear. Such contacts can lead to new contagion events. In fact, mobility has been a crucial target for early non-pharmaceutical containment measures against the recent COVID-19 pandemic, with a degree of intensity ranging from public transportation line closures to regional, city or even home confinements. Nonetheless, quantitative knowledge on the relationship between mobility-contagions and, consequently, on the efficiency of containment measures remains elusive. Here we introduce an agent-based model with a simple interaction between mobility and contacts. Despite its simplicity our model shows the emergence of a critical mobility level, inducing major outbreaks when surpassed. We explore the interplay between mobility restrictions and the infection in recent intervention policies seen across many countries, and how interventions in the form of closures triggered by incidence rates can guide the epidemic into an oscillatory regime with recurrent waves. We consider how the different interventions impact societal well-being, the economy and the population. Finally, we propose a mitigation framework based on the critical nature of mobility in an epidemic, able to suppress incidence and oscillations at will, preventing extreme incidence peaks with potential to saturate health care resources.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 15:16:44 UTC (7,756 KB)"
"28","Evolution of commitment in the spatial Public Goods Game through institutional incentives","Lucas S. Flores, The Anh Han","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Studying social dilemmas prompts the question of how cooperation can emerge in situations where individuals are expected to act selfishly. Here, in the framework of the one-shot Public Goods Game (PGG), we introduce the concept that individuals can potentially adjust their behaviour based on the cooperative commitments made by other players in the group prior to the actual PGG interaction. To this end, we establish a commitment threshold that group members must meet for a commitment to be formed. We explore the effects of punishing commitment non-compliant players (those who commit and defect if the commitment is formed) and rewarding commitment-compliant players (those who commit and cooperate if the commitment is formed). In the presence of commitment and absence of an incentive mechanism, we observe that conditional behaviour based on commitment alone can enhance cooperation, especially when considering a specific commitment threshold value. In the presence of punishment, our findings suggest that the survival of cooperation most likely happen at intermediate commitment thresholds. Notably, cooperation is maximised at high thresholds, when punishment occurs more frequently. We also see that when cooperation rarely survives, a cyclic behaviour emerges, facilitating the persistence of cooperation. For the reward case, we found that cooperation is highly frequent regardless of the commitment threshold adopted.","Thu, 8 Feb 2024 10:38:12 UTC (269 KB)"

Rhâmidda, Mauricio Girardi-Schappo, Osame Kinouchi","Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems (nlin.AO)","Transient or partial synchronization can be used to do computations, although a fully synchronized network is frequently related to epileptic seizures. Here, we propose a homeostatic mechanism that is capable of maintaining a neuronal network at the edge of a synchronization transition, thereby avoiding the harmful consequences of a fully synchronized network. We model neurons by maps since they are dynamically richer than integrate-and-fire models and more computationally efficient than conductance-based approaches. We first describe the synchronization phase transition of a dense network of neurons with different tonic spiking frequencies coupled by gap junctions. We show that at the transition critical point, inputs optimally reverberate through the network activity through transient synchronization. Then, we introduce a local homeostatic dynamic in the synaptic coupling and show that it produces a robust self-organization toward the edge of this phase transition. We discuss the potential biological consequences of this self-organization process, such as its relation to the Brain Criticality hypothesis, its input processing capacity, and how its malfunction could lead to pathological synchronization.","Wed, 7 Feb 2024 17:03:20 UTC (8,928 KB)"

However, HET-s AF, by their morphology and function, have only little in common to pathogenic amyloid fibers such as {\alpha}-synuclein or a\b{eta} and they have appeared as promising candidate for biocoating since few years. Here we have shown than HET-s amyloid fibers hydrogel is an extremely polyvalent coating material for the in vitro culture of primary hippocampal neurons. First, the non-cytotoxicity was demonstrated in vitro using standardized ISO protocols. Then, it is shown that in vitro culture of primary hippocampal neurons on HET-s AF hydrogels could last more than 45 days with clear signatures of spontaneous network activity, with which is a feat that not many other coatings have achieved yet. Finally, interactions between the cells, the dendrites and the hydrogels are highlighted, showing that dendrites might be able to penetrate the hydrogels in depth, therefore allowing recordings even within micrometer-thick hydrogels. In the end, those properties combined with group functionalization using standard biochemistry techniques, makes HET-s hydrogels ideal candidates to be used for the long-term growth of neurons as well as other types of cells. This versatility and easiness to use are definitely still unheard, especially for protein material. Due to its ability to transform from dry films to hydrogel when in contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM), it could also be used for in vivo implants, solving the issue of hydrogel damaging during the implant surgery.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 20:38:51 UTC (2,662 KB)"

Ellingsen (for the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder leading to cognitive decline. [$^{18}$F]-Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography ([$^{18}$F]-FDG PET) is used to monitor brain metabolism, aiding in the diagnosis and assessment of AD over time. However, the feasibility of multi-time point [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans for diagnosis is limited due to radiation exposure, cost, and patient burden. To address this, we have developed a predictive image-to-image translation (I2I) model to forecast future [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET scans using baseline and year-one data. The proposed model employs a convolutional neural network architecture with long-short term memory and was trained on [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET data from 161 individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Our I2I network showed high accuracy in predicting year-two [18F]-FDG PET scans, with a mean absolute error of 0.031 and a structural similarity index of 0.961. Furthermore, the model successfully predicted PET scans up to seven years post-baseline. Notably, the predicted [$^{18}$F]-FDG PET signal in an AD-susceptible meta-region was highly accurate for individuals with mild cognitive impairment across years. In contrast, a linear model was sufficient for predicting brain metabolism in cognitively normal and dementia subjects. In conclusion, both the I2I network and the linear model could offer valuable prognostic insights, guiding early intervention strategies to preemptively address anticipated declines in brain metabolism and potentially to monitor treatment effects.","Tue, 6 Feb 2024 16:02:51 UTC (6,424 KB)"

Materials and Methods: Phantoms of polyethylene, gelatin or poly(methyl methacrylate) were irradiated with monoenergetic carbon and oxygen ion beams. Post-irradiation, 4D PET images were acquired and parent $^{11}$C, $^{10}$C and $^{15}$O radionuclides contributions in each voxel were determined from the extracted time activity curves. Experiments were simulated in Geant4 Monte Carlo versions 10-11.1, with three different fragmentation models: binary ion cascade (BIC), quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) and the Liege intranuclear cascade (INCL++) - 30 combinations. Total/parent isotope positron annihilation yields were compared between simulations and experiments using normalised mean squared error and Pearson cross-correlation coefficient. Depth of maximum/distal 50\% peak position yield were also compared. Results: Performance varied considerably across versions and models, with no one best predicting all positron-emitting fragments. BIC in Geant4 10.2 provided the best overall agreement with experimental results in the largest number of test cases. QMD consistently provided the best estimates of both the depth of peak positron yield (10.4 and 10.6) and the distal 50\%-of-peak point (10.2), while BIC also performed well and INCL generally performed the worst across most Geant4 versions. Conclusions: Best spatial prediction of annihilation yield and positron-emitting fragment production during carbon and oxygen ion therapy was found to be 10.2.p03 with BIC or QMD. These version/model combinations are recommended for future heavy ion therapy research.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 20:31:34 UTC (2,342 KB)"

GAI has recently shown impressive results across a large spectrum of applications ranging from biology, medicine, education, legislation, computer science, and finance. As one strives for enhanced safety, efficiency, and sustainability, generative AI indeed emerges as a key differentiator and promises a paradigm shift in the field. This paper explores the potential applications of generative AI and large language models in geoscience. The recent developments in the field of machine learning and deep learning have enabled the generative model's utility for tackling diverse prediction problems, simulation, and multi-criteria decision-making challenges related to geoscience and Earth system dynamics. This survey discusses several GAI models that have been used in geoscience comprising generative adversarial networks (GANs), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), and generative pre-trained transformer (GPT)-based structures. These tools have helped the geoscience community in several applications, including (but not limited to) data generation/augmentation, super-resolution, panchromatic sharpening, haze removal, restoration, and land surface changing. Some challenges still remain such as ensuring physical interpretation, nefarious use cases, and trustworthiness.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have proven instrumental in characterizing such spatial heterogeneities and probing the impact of confinement on materials' properties. For static properties, this is a straightforward task and can be achieved via simple spatial binning. Such an approach, however, cannot be readily applied to transport coefficients due to lack of natural extensions of autocorrelations used for their calculation in the bulk. The prime example of this challenge is diffusivity, which, in the bulk, can be readily estimated from the particles' mobility statistics, which satisfy the Fokker-Planck equation. Under confinement, however, such statistics will follow the Smoluchowski equation, which lacks a closed-form analytical solution. This brief review explores the rich history of estimating profiles of the diffusivity tensor from MD simulations and discusses various approximate methods and algorithms developed for this purpose. Beside discussing heuristic extensions of bulk methods, we overview more rigorous algorithms, including kernel-based methods, Bayesian approaches, and operator discretization techniques. Additionally, we outline methods based on applying biasing potentials or imposing constraints on tracer particles. Finally, we discuss approaches that estimate diffusivity from mean first passage time or committor probability profiles, a conceptual framework originally developed in the context of collective variable spaces describing rare events in computational chemistry and biology. In summary, this paper offers a concise survey of diverse approaches for estimating diffusivity from MD trajectories, highlighting challenges and opportunities in this area.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 18:41:46 UTC (2,694 KB)"

By applying a Brownian dynamics algorithm to simulate molecule diffusion, we describe how ER tube geometry influences whether a searcher will encounter a nearby target or instead diffuse away to a region near to a distinct target, as well as the timescale of successful searches. We find that targets are more likely to be found for longer and narrower tubes, and larger targets, and that search in the tube volume is more sensitive to the search geometry compared to search on the tube surface. Our results suggest ER proteins searching for low-density targets in the membrane and the lumen are very likely to encounter the nearest target before diffusing to the vicinity of another target. Our results have implications for the design of target search simulations and calculations and interpretation of molecular trajectories on the ER network, as well as other organelles with tubular geometry.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 14:49:29 UTC (366 KB)"

One notable characteristic of these systems is their ability to simulate concentration phenomena, where cell density undergoes rapid growth near specific concentration points or along certain curves. Such growth can result in singular, spiky structures and lead to finite-time blowups. Our investigation focuses on the dynamics of the Patlak-Keller-Segel chemotaxis system and its two-species extensions. In the latter case, different species may exhibit distinct chemotactic sensitivities, giving rise to very different rates of cell density growth. Such a situation may be extremely challenging for numerical methods as they may fail to accurately capture the blowup of the slower-growing species mainly due to excessive numerical dissipation. In this paper, we propose a hybrid finite-difference-particle (FDP) method, in which a particle method is used to solve the chemotaxis equation(s), while finite difference schemes are employed to solve the chemoattractant equation. Thanks to the low-dissipation nature of the particle method, the proposed hybrid scheme is particularly adept at capturing the blowup behaviors in both one- and two-species cases. The proposed hybrid FDP methods are tested on a series of challenging examples, and the obtained numerical results demonstrate that our hybrid method can provide sharp resolution of the singular structures even with a relatively small number of particles. Moreover, in the two-species case, our method adeptly captures the blowing-up solution for the component with lower chemotactic sensitivity, a feature not observed in other works.","Mon, 5 Feb 2024 08:38:03 UTC (1,465 KB)"

We first show that our model connects resources in an efficient manner when the environment is constant. We then show that in an oscillatory environment our model builds efficient solutions, provided the environmental oscillations are sufficiently out of phase. We show that amplitude differences can promote efficient solutions and that the system is robust to frequency differences. We identify connections between our model and basal cognition in biological systems and slime moulds, in particular, showing how oscillatory and problem-solving properties of these systems are captured by our model.","Sun, 4 Feb 2024 15:08:02 UTC (34,684 KB)"

Goldman","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","The nervous system reorganizes memories from an early site to a late site, a commonly observed feature of learning and memory systems known as systems consolidation. Previous work has suggested learning rules by which consolidation may occur. Here, we provide conditions under which such rules are guaranteed to lead to stable convergence of learning and consolidation. We use the theory of Lyapunov functions, which enforces stability by requiring learning rules to decrease an energy-like (Lyapunov) function. We present the theory in the context of a simple circuit architecture motivated by classic models of learning in systems consolidation mediated by the cerebellum. Stability is only guaranteed if the learning rate in the late stage is not faster than the learning rate in the early stage. Further, the slower the learning rate at the late stage, the larger the perturbation the system can tolerate with a guarantee of stability. We provide intuition for this result by mapping the consolidation model to a damped driven oscillator system, and showing that the ratio of early- to late-stage learning rates in the consolidation model can be directly identified with the (square of the) oscillator's damping ratio. This work suggests the power of the Lyapunov approach to provide constraints on nervous system function.","Fri, 2 Feb 2024 18:07:40 UTC (719 KB)"

However, as experiments record from larger and larger populations, we approach a fundamental bottleneck: the number of correlations one would like to include in a model grows larger than the available data. In this undersampled regime, one must focus on a sparse subset of correlations; the optimal choice contains the maximum information about patterns of activity or, equivalently, minimizes the entropy of the inferred maximum entropy model. Applying this ``minimax entropy"" principle is generally intractable, but here we present an exact and scalable solution for pairwise correlations that combine to form a tree (a network without loops). Applying our method to over one thousand neurons in the mouse hippocampus, we find that the optimal tree of correlations reduces our uncertainty about the population activity by 14% (over 50 times more than a random tree). Despite containing only 0.1% of all pairwise correlations, this minimax entropy model accurately predicts the observed large-scale synchrony in neural activity and becomes even more accurate as the population grows. The inferred Ising model is almost entirely ferromagnetic (with positive interactions) and exhibits signatures of thermodynamic criticality.

It is based on our recently developed theory of electric field wave propagation in anisotropic and inhomogeneous brain tissues, which has been shown to explain a broad range of observed coherent synchronous brain electrical processes. We demonstrate that this theory also explains the spiking behavior of single neurons, thus bridging the gap between the fundamental element of brain electrical activity (the neuron) and large-scale coherent synchronous electrical activity. Our analysis indicates that the membrane interface of the axonal cellular system can be mathematically described by a nonlinear system with several small parameters. This allows for the rigorous derivation of an accurate yet simpler nonlinear model following the formal small parameter expansion. The resulting action potential model exhibits a smooth, continuous transition from the linear oscillatory regime to the nonlinear spiking regime, as well as a critical transition to a non-oscillatory regime. These transitions occur with changes in the criticality parameter and include several different bifurcation types, representative of the various experimentally detected neuron types. This new theory overcomes the limitations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, such as the inability to explain extracellular spiking, efficient brain synchronization, saltatory conduction along myelinated axons, and a variety of other observed coherent macroscopic brain electrical phenomena. We also show that the standard cable axon theory can be recovered by our approach, using the very crude assumptions of piece-wise homogeneity and isotropy. However, the diffusion process described by the cable equation is not capable of supporting action potential propagation across a wide range of experimentally reported axon parameters.","Wed, 31 Jan 2024 18:14:36 UTC (304 KB)[v2] Wed, 14 Feb 2024 16:25:59 UTC (304 KB)"

And the discovery of the mysterious quantum mechanics has made it fundamental; and expectedly it is being addressed in quantum physics: the efforts are in the context of the genesis of the universe; from its quantum beginning to its possible quantum to-physical reduction; the end that we experience. The requirement for the reduction arises due to quantum particles multimodal indefinite existence; probabilistic varying sites and characteristics. Therefore, a real classical universe could only result from a universal autonomous reduction, which nonetheless may have happened despite lack of a falsifiable proof theory. The other possibility (avoiding the cataclysmic event) could be world classicality due to reduction in our minds, or brains. New findings about the latency of consciousness, point to autonomous brain as the site of such event. The scheme for such reductions is figured out in the interpretation theories of measurement of simple quantum systems of particles, which can also explicate having one definite universe from many indefinite alternatives of the quantum universe. The anthropocentric approaches are at best ad hoc and rely on choice, prompting of which remains unknown. My approach avoids these issues by isolating two entangled subsystems out of the pure quantum universe; the photons-phonons and beings nervous subsystems. Ignoring the remaining entangled mass particle subsystem, renders others in statistical correlation states (not quantum), where survival brain patterns make the selection. This state of the brain, forces also the selection of its entangled (mass) environment; and thus embracing the information of the mass particle universe, its classicality streamed to our consciousness; after all, our connection with everything external to us is through photons and phonons","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 23:01:29 UTC (66 KB)"

To overcome this challenge, we develop an approach combining enhanced sampling with deep generative models and active learning of a machine learning potential (MLP). We introduce an adaptive Markov chain Monte Carlo framework that enables the training of one Normalizing Flow (NF) and one MLP per state. We simulate several Markov chains in parallel until they reach convergence, sampling the Boltzmann distribution with an efficient use of energy evaluations. At each iteration, we compute the energy of a subset of the NF-generated configurations using Density Functional Theory (DFT), we predict the remaining configuration's energy with the MLP and actively train the MLP using the DFT-computed energies. Leveraging the trained NF and MLP models, we can compute thermodynamic observables such as free-energy differences or optical spectra. We apply this method to study the isomerization of an ultrasmall silver nanocluster, belonging to a set of systems with diverse applications in the fields of medicine and catalysis.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 19:01:31 UTC (5,901 KB)"

While most of previous game-theoretic work adopt the imitation learning where players imitate the strategies who are better off, the learning logic in the real world is often much more complex. In this work, we turn to the reinforcement learning paradigm, where individuals make their decisions based upon their past experience and long-term returns. Specifically, we investigate the Prisoners' dilemma game with Q-learning algorithm, and cooperators probabilistically pose punishment on defectors in their neighborhood. Interestingly, we find that punishment could lead to either continuous or discontinuous cooperation phase transitions, and the nucleation process of cooperation clusters is reminiscent of the liquid-gas transition. The uncovered first-order phase transition indicates that great care needs to be taken when implementing the punishment compared to the continuous scenario.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 11:30:35 UTC (1,913 KB)"

Although the majority of real-world particles exhibit anisotropy, their behavior has been studied less than that of isotropic particles. In this study, we introduce a new method for estimating the diffusion coefficients of individual anisotropic particles using short-trajectory data on the basis of a maximum likelihood framework. Traditional estimation techniques often use mean-squared displacement (MSD) values or other statistical measures that inherently remove angular information. Instead, we treated the angle as a latent variable and used belief propagation to estimate it while maximizing the likelihood using the expectation-maximization algorithm. Compared to conventional methods, this approach facilitates better estimation of shorter trajectories and faster rotations, as confirmed by numerical simulations and experimental data involving bacteria and quantum rods. Additionally, we performed an analytical investigation of the limits of detectability of anisotropy and provided guidelines for the experimental design. In addition to serving as a powerful tool for analyzing complex systems, the proposed method will pave the way for applying maximum likelihood methods to more complex diffusion phenomena.","Mon, 29 Jan 2024 06:32:42 UTC (2,408 KB)"

Fontanari, Mauro Santos","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Understanding the conditions for maintaining cooperation in groups of unrelated individuals despite the presence of non-cooperative members is a major research topic in contemporary biological, sociological, and economic theory. The $N$-person snowdrift game models the type of social dilemma where cooperative actions are costly, but there is a reward for performing them. We study this game in a scenario where players move between play groups following the casual group dynamics, where groups grow by recruiting isolates and shrink by losing individuals who then become isolates. This describes the size distribution of spontaneous human groups and also the formation of sleeping groups in monkeys. We consider three scenarios according to the probability of isolates joining a group. We find that for appropriate choices of the cost-benefit ratio of cooperation and the aggregation-disaggregation ratio in the formation of casual groups, free-riders can be completely eliminated from the population. If individuals are more attracted to large groups, we find that cooperators persist in the population even when the mean group size diverges. We also point out the remarkable similarity between the replicator equation approach to public goods games and the trait group formulation of structured demes.","Sun, 28 Jan 2024 20:46:26 UTC (43 KB)"

"55","Limited data on infectious disease distribution exposes ambiguity in epidemic modeling choices","Laura Di Domenico, Eugenio Valdano, Vittoria Colizza","Populations and Evolution (q-bio.PE)","Traditional disease transmission models assume that the infectious period is exponentially distributed with a recovery rate fixed in time and across individuals. This assumption provides analytical and computational advantages, however it is often unrealistic. Efforts in modeling non-exponentially distributed infectious periods are either limited to special cases or lead to unsolvable models. Also, the link between empirical data (infectious period distribution) and the modeling needs (corresponding recovery rates) lacks a clear understanding. Here we introduce a mapping of an arbitrary distribution of infectious periods into a distribution of recovery rates. We show that the same infectious period distribution at the population level can be reproduced by two modeling schemes -- host-based and population-based -- depending on the individual response to the infection, and aggregated empirical data cannot easily discriminate the correct scheme. Besides being conceptually different, the two schemes also lead to different epidemic trajectories. Although sharing the same behavior close to the disease-free equilibrium, the host-based scheme deviates from the expected epidemic when reaching the endemic equilibrium of an SIS transmission model, while the population-based scheme turns out to be equivalent to assuming a homogeneous recovery rate. We show this through analytical computations and stochastic epidemic simulations on a contact network, using both generative network models and empirical contact data. It is therefore possible to reproduce heterogeneous infectious periods in network-based transmission models, however the resulting prevalence is sensitive to the modeling choice for the interpretation of the empirically collected data on infection duration. In absence of higher resolution data, studies should acknowledge such deviations in the epidemic predictions.","Fri, 26 Jan 2024 20:24:02 UTC (1,294 KB)"

With this purpose, we have firstly optimized the development of a target-specific nanocarrier by coupling a specific fluorescent antibody on the surface of functionalized lipid liquid nanocapsules (LLNCs). Thus, an anti-HER2-FITC antibody ({\alpha}HER2) has been used, HER2 being a surface receptor that is overexpressed in several tumor cells. Subsequently, the in vitro formation of a PC has been developed using fetal bovine serum supplemented with human fibrinogen. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS), Nanoparticle Tracking Analysis (NTA), Laser Doppler Electrophoresis (LDE), and Gel Chromatography techniques have been used to assure a complete physico-chemical characterization of the nano-complexes with (LLNCs-{\alpha}HER2-PC) and without (LLNCs-{\alpha}HER2) the surrounding PC. In addition, cellular assays were performed to study the cellular uptake and the specific cellular-nanocarrier interactions using the SKBR3 (high expression of HER2) breast cancer cell line and human dermal fibroblasts (HDFa) (healthy cell line without expression of HER2 receptors as control), showing that the SKBR3 cell line had a higher transport rate (50-fold) than HDFa at 60 min with LLNCs-{\alpha}HER2. Moreover, the SKBR3 cell line incubated with LLNCs-{\alpha}HER2-PC suffered a significant reduction (40%) in the uptake. These results suggest that the formation of a PC onto LLNCs does not prevent specific cell targeting, although it does have an important influence on cell uptake.","Fri, 19 Jan 2024 08:09:53 UTC (757 KB)"
"57","Temperature Compensation through Kinetic Regulation in Biochemical Oscillators","Haochen Fu, Chenyi Fei, Qi Ouyang, Yuhai Tu","Molecular Networks (q-bio.MN)","Nearly all circadian clocks maintain a period that is insensitive to temperature changes, a phenomenon known as temperature compensation (TC). Yet, it is unclear whether there is any common feature among different systems that exhibit TC. From a general timescale invariance, we show that TC relies on existence of certain period-lengthening reactions wherein the period of the system increases strongly with the rates in these reactions. By studying several generic oscillator models, we show that this counter-intuitive dependence is nonetheless a common feature of oscillators in the nonlinear (far-from-onset) regime where the oscillation can be separated into fast and slow phases. The increase of the period with the period-lengthening reaction rates occurs when the amplitude of the slow phase in the oscillation increases with these rates while the progression-speed in the slow phase is controlled by other rates of the system. The positive dependence of the period on the period-lengthening rates balances its inverse dependence on other kinetic rates in the system, which gives rise to robust TC in a wide range of parameters. We demonstrate the existence of such period-lengthening reactions and their relevance for TC in all four model systems we considered. Theoretical results for a model of the Kai system are supported by experimental data. A study of the energy dissipation also shows that better TC performance requires higher energy consumption. Our study unveils a general mechanism by which a biochemical oscillator achieves TC by operating at regimes far from the onset where period-lengthening reactions exist.","Thu, 25 Jan 2024 05:40:16 UTC (7,472 KB)"

Stone","Fluid Dynamics (physics.flu-dyn)","The Marangoni flow induced by an insoluble surfactant on a fluid-fluid interface is a fundamental problem investigated extensively due to its implications in colloid science, biology, the environment, and industrial applications. Here, we study the limit of a deep liquid subphase with negligible inertia (low Reynolds number $Re\ll{1}$), where the two-dimensional problem has been shown to be described by the complex Burgers equation. We analyze the problem through a self-similar formulation, providing further insights into its structure and revealing its universal features. Six different similarity solutions are found. One of the solutions includes surfactant diffusion, whereas the other five, which are identified through a phase-plane formalism, hold only in the limit of negligible diffusion (high surface Péclet number $Pe_s\gg{1}$). Surfactant `pulses', with a locally higher concentration that spreads outward, lead to two similarity solutions of the first kind with a similarity exponent $\beta=1/2$. On the other hand, distributions that are locally depleted and flow inwards lead to similarity of the second kind, with two different exponents that we obtain exactly using stability arguments. We distinguish between `dimple' solutions, where the surfactant has a quadratic minimum and $\beta=2$, from `hole' solutions, where the concentration profile is flatter than quadratic and $\beta=3/2$. Each of these two cases exhibits two similarity solutions, one prior to a critical time $t_*$ when the derivative of the concentration is singular, and another one valid after $t_*$. We obtain all six solutions in closed form, and discuss useful predictions that can be extracted from these results.","Wed, 24 Jan 2024 18:31:08 UTC (7,440 KB)"

To shed light on how behavioral norms can resolve the social dilemma of cooperation, here we present a formal mathematical model of individuals' decision making under general social norms, encompassing a variety of concerns and motivations an individual may have beyond simply maximizing their own payoffs. Using the canonical game of the Prisoner's Dilemma, we compare four different norms: compassion, universalizability, reciprocity, and equity, to determine which social forces can facilitate the evolution of cooperation, if any. We analyze our model through a variety of limiting cases, including weak selection, low mutation, and large population sizes. This is complemented by computer simulations of population dynamics via a Fisher process, which confirm our theoretical results. We find that the first two norms lead to the emergence of cooperation in a wide range of games, but the latter two do not on their own. Due to its generality, our framework can be used to investigate many more norms, as well as how norms themselves emerge and evolve. Our work complements recent work on fair-minded learning dynamics and provides a useful bottom-up perspective into understanding the impact of top-down social norms on collective cooperative intelligence.","Tue, 23 Jan 2024 16:42:13 UTC (2,279 KB)"

Traditional research has focused on deterministic rules governing pairwise interactions, yet the impact of interaction frequency and synchronicity on cooperation remains underexplored. Addressing this gap, our work introduces two temporal interaction mechanisms to model the stochastic or periodic participation of individuals in these games, acknowledging real-life variances due to exogenous temporal factors and geographical time differences. We consider that the interaction state significantly influences both game payoff calculations and the strategy updating process, offering new insights into the emergence and sustainability of cooperation. Our results indicate that maximum game participation frequency is suboptimal under a stochastic interaction mechanism. Instead, an intermediate region of activation probability yields the highest cooperation level, especially under strong dilemma conditions. This suggests that a balance between inactivity security and interaction frequency is crucial. Furthermore, local synchronization of interactions within specific areas is shown to be beneficial, as time differences hinder the spread of cross-structures but promote the formation of dense cooperative clusters with smoother boundaries. Our findings provide an intuitive understanding of node-based temporality and probabilistic interactions, contributing to the broader discourse on resolving social dilemmas.","Mon, 22 Jan 2024 09:29:32 UTC (22,294 KB)[v2] Mon, 5 Feb 2024 13:29:42 UTC (15,587 KB)"

Byrne","Tissues and Organs (q-bio.TO)","In this work we develop a homogenisation methodology to upscale mathematical descriptions of microcirculatory blood flow from the microscale (where individual vessels are resolved) to the macroscopic (or tissue) scale. Due to the assumed two-phase nature of blood and specific features of red blood cells (RBCs), mathematical models for blood flow in the microcirculation are highly nonlinear, coupling the flow and RBC concentrations (haematocrit). In contrast to previous works which accomplished blood-flow homogenisation by assuming that the haematocrit level remains constant, here we allow for spatial heterogeneity in the haematocrit concentration and thus begin with a nonlinear microscale model. We simplify the analysis by considering the limit of small haematocrit heterogeneity which prevails when variations in haematocrit concentration between neighbouring vessels are small. Homogenisation results in a system of coupled, nonlinear partial differential equations describing the flow and haematocrit transport at the macroscale, in which a nonlinear Darcy-type model relates the flow and pressure gradient via a haematocrit-dependent permeability tensor. During the analysis we obtain further that haematocrit transport at the macroscale is governed by a purely advective equation. Applying the theory to particular examples of two- and three-dimensional geometries of periodic networks, we calculate the effective permeability tensor associated with blood flow in these vascular networks. We demonstrate how the statistical distribution of vessel lengths and diameters, together with the average haematocrit level, affect the statistical properties of the macroscopic permeability tensor. These data can be used to simulate blood flow and haematocrit transport at the macroscale.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 21:51:22 UTC (678 KB)"

Krishnapriyan","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Developing equivariant neural networks for the E(3) group plays an important role in modeling 3D data across real-world applications. Enforcing this equivariance primarily involves the tensor products of irreducible representations (irreps). However, the computational complexity of such operations increases significantly as higher-order tensors are used. In this work, we propose a systematic approach to substantially accelerate the computation of the tensor products of irreps. We mathematically connect the commonly used Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to the Gaunt coefficients, which are integrals of products of three spherical harmonics. Through Gaunt coefficients, the tensor product of irreps becomes equivalent to the multiplication between spherical functions represented by spherical harmonics. This perspective further allows us to change the basis for the equivariant operations from spherical harmonics to a 2D Fourier basis. Consequently, the multiplication between spherical functions represented by a 2D Fourier basis can be efficiently computed via the convolution theorem and Fast Fourier Transforms. This transformation reduces the complexity of full tensor products of irreps from $\mathcal{O}(L^6)$ to $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$, where $L$ is the max degree of irreps. Leveraging this approach, we introduce the Gaunt Tensor Product, which serves as a new method to construct efficient equivariant operations across different model architectures. Our experiments on the Open Catalyst Project and 3BPA datasets demonstrate both the increased efficiency and improved performance of our approach.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 18:57:10 UTC (169 KB)"

This strategy delivered one of the lowest pandemic mortality rates in the world. However, quantitative estimates of the population-level health benefits of vaccination are lacking. Here, we use a validated mathematical model to investigate counterfactual scenarios with differing levels of vaccine coverage in different age and ethnicity groups. The model builds on earlier research by adding age- and time-dependent case ascertainment, the effect of antiviral medications, improved hospitalisation rate estimates, and the impact of relaxing control measures. The model was used for scenario analysis and policy advice for the New Zealand Government in 2022 and 2023. We compare the number of Covid-19 hospitalisations, deaths, and years of life lost in each counterfactual scenario to a baseline scenario that is fitted to epidemiological data between January 2022 and June 2023. Our results estimate that vaccines saved 6650 (95% credible interval [4424, 10180]) lives, and prevented 74500 [51000, 115400] years of life lost and 45100 [34400, 55600] hospitalisations during this 18-month period. Making the same comparison before the benefit of antiviral medications is accounted for, the estimated number of lives saved by vaccines increases to 7604 [5080, 11942]. Due to inequities in the vaccine rollout, vaccination rates among Māori were lower than in people of European ethnicity. Our results show that, if vaccination rates had been equitable, an estimated 11-26% of the 292 Māori Covid-19 deaths that were recorded in this time period could have been prevented. We conclude that Covid-19 vaccination greatly reduced health burden in New Zealand and that equity needs to be a key focus of future vaccination programmes.","Thu, 18 Jan 2024 02:07:56 UTC (1,534 KB)[v2] Fri, 26 Jan 2024 00:47:39 UTC (1,084 KB)"

Together these theories imply that life is expected as a phase transition in the evolving universe. The familiar distinction between software and hardware loses its meaning in living cells.

The rapid advancement of machine learning, particularly within the domain of deep generative networks, has revolutionized the precision of predictive modeling in this context. Traditional approaches often adopt a two-step strategy: initially estimating interatomic distances and subsequently refining the spatial molecular structure by solving a distance geometry problem. However, this sequential approach occasionally falls short in accurately capturing the intricacies of local atomic arrangements, thereby compromising the fidelity of the resulting structural models. Addressing these limitations, this research introduces a cutting-edge generative framework named \method{}.

By combining minimal mathematical modelling, Bayesian inference, and recent experimental data, we quantify the impact of mechanical constraints across different cell cycle stages in epithelial tissue expansion experiments. Our model suggests that cells sense local density and adapt cell cycle progression in response, during G1 and the combined S/G2/M phases, providing an explicit relationship between each cell cycle stage duration and local tissue density, which is consistent with several experimental observations. Finally, we compare our mathematical model predictions to different experiments studying cell cycle regulation and present a quantitative analysis on the impact of mechanical constraints on cell migration patterns. Our work presents a systematic approach for investigating and analysing cell cycle data, providing mechanistic insights into how individual cells regulate proliferation, based on population-based experimental measurements.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 20:01:59 UTC (17,681 KB)[v2] Thu, 1 Feb 2024 15:51:26 UTC (17,998 KB)"

Koenderink","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","Cell migration is a fundamental process for life and is highly dependent on the dynamical and mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. Intensive physical and biochemical crosstalk between actin, microtubules, and intermediate filaments ensures their coordination to facilitate and enable migration. In this review we discuss the different mechanical aspects that govern cell migration and provide, for each mechanical aspect, a novel perspective by juxtaposing two complementary approaches to the biophysical study of cytoskeletal crosstalk: live-cell studies (often referred to as top-down studies) and cell-free studies (often referred to as bottom-up studies). We summarize the main findings from both experimental approaches, and we provide our perspective on bridging the two perspectives to address the open questions of how cytoskeletal crosstalk governs cell migration and makes cells move.","Tue, 16 Jan 2024 13:52:58 UTC (41,115 KB)"
"74","Predicting heteropolymer interactions: demixing and hypermixing of disordered protein sequences","Kyosuke Adachi, Kyogo Kawaguchi","Soft Condensed Matter (cond-mat.soft)","Cells contain multiple condensates which spontaneously form due to the heterotypic interactions between their components. Although the proteins and disordered region sequences that are responsible for condensate formation have been extensively studied, the rule of interactions between the components that allow demixing, i.e., the coexistence of multiple condensates, is yet to be elucidated. Here we construct an effective theory of the interaction between heteropolymers by fitting it to the molecular dynamics simulation results obtained for more than 200 sequences sampled from the disordered regions of human proteins. We find that the sum of amino acid pair interactions across two heteropolymers predicts the Boyle temperature qualitatively well, which can be quantitatively improved by the dimer pair approximation, where we incorporate the effect of neighboring amino acids in the sequences. The improved theory, combined with the finding of a metric that captures the effective interaction strength between distinct sequences, allowed the selection of up to three disordered region sequences that demix with each other in multicomponent simulations, as well as the generation of artificial sequences that demix with a given sequence. The theory points to a generic sequence design strategy to demix or hypermix thanks to the low dimensional nature of the space of the interactions that we identify. As a consequence of the geometric arguments in the space of interactions, we find that the number of distinct sequences that can demix with each other is strongly constrained, irrespective of the choice of the coarse-grained model. Altogether, we construct a theoretical basis for methods to estimate the effective interaction between heteropolymers, which can be utilized in predicting phase separation properties as well as rules of assignment in the localization and functions of disordered proteins.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 16:53:31 UTC (11,963 KB)[v2] Fri, 19 Jan 2024 13:58:38 UTC (11,967 KB)"

Cebral","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Vascular calcification is implicated as an important factor in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), including heart attack and stroke. A controversy remains over how to integrate the diverse forms of vascular calcification into clinical risk assessment tools. Even the commonly used calcium score for coronary arteries, which assumes risk scales positively with total calcification, has important inconsistencies. Fundamental studies are needed to determine how risk is influenced by the diverse calcification phenotypes. However, studies of these kinds are hindered by the lack of high-throughput, objective, and non-destructive tools for classifying calcification in imaging data sets. Here, we introduce a new classification system for phenotyping calcification along with a semi-automated, non-destructive pipeline that can distinguish these phenotypes in even atherosclerotic tissues. The pipeline includes a deep-learning-based framework for segmenting lipid pools in noisy micro-CT images and an unsupervised clustering framework for categorizing calcification based on size, clustering, and topology. This approach is illustrated for five vascular specimens, providing phenotyping for thousands of calcification particles across as many as 3200 images in less than seven hours. Average Dice Similarity Coefficients of 0.96 and 0.87 could be achieved for tissue and lipid pool, respectively, with training and validation needed on only 13 images despite the high heterogeneity in these tissues. By introducing an efficient and comprehensive approach to phenotyping calcification, this work enables large-scale studies to identify a more reliable indicator of the risk of cardiovascular events, a leading cause of global mortality and morbidity.","Mon, 15 Jan 2024 16:53:20 UTC (2,956 KB)[v2] Wed, 17 Jan 2024 15:23:00 UTC (2,956 KB)"

We develop models of diffusing lipids and channels engaged in Ising-like interactions to investigate the collective behaviors driven by raft formation in critical membranes close to the demixing transition. The model channels demonstrate lipid-mediated long-range interactions, activation curve steepening, and long-term memory in ionic currents.

Most existing methods to infer GRNs from experimental data have limited predictive power as the inferred GRNs merely reflect gene expression similarity or correlation. Here, we demonstrate, how physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) can be used to infer the parameters of predictive, dynamical GRNs that provide mechanistic understanding of biological processes. Specifically we study GRNs that exhibit bifurcation behavior and can therefore model cell differentiation. We show that PINNs outperform regular feed-forward neural networks on the parameter inference task and analyze two relevant experimental scenarios: 1. a system with cell communication for which gene expression trajectories are available and 2. snapshot measurements of a cell population in which cell communication is absent. Our analysis will inform the design of future experiments to be analyzed with PINNs and provides a starting point to explore this powerful class of neural network models further.","Sun, 14 Jan 2024 21:43:10 UTC (7,059 KB)"

We propose a poroelastic model for elastic deformation and liquid transport in three dimensional biofilms spreading on agar surfaces. The motion of the boundaries can be described by the combined use of Von Karman type approximations for the agar/biofilm interface and thin film approximations for the biofilm/air interface. Bacterial activity informs the macroscopic continuous model through source terms and residual stresses, either phenomenological or derived from microscopic models. We present a procedure to estimate the structure of such residual stresses, based on a simple cellular automata description of bacterial activity. Inspired by image processing, we show that a filtering strategy effectively smooths out the rough tensors provided by the stochastic cellular automata rules, allowing us to insert them in the macroscopic model without numerical instability.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 12:30:23 UTC (176 KB)"

In this article, by applying information geometric methods, such a construction is provided. The idea is to track how concentration changes in a particular chemical propagate to changes of all the other chemicals within a steady state. This is encoded in the matrix of absolute sensitivites. A linear algebraic characterization of the matrix of absolute sensitivities for quasi-thermostatic CRN is derived via a Cramer-Rao bound for CRN, which is based on the the analogy between quasi-thermostatic steady states and the exponential family of probability distributions.","Sat, 13 Jan 2024 06:00:45 UTC (234 KB)"

We are able to reproduce both types of shapes through elastic rod and plate models that incorporate information from the biomass production and differentiations process, such as growth rates, growth tensors or inner stresses, as well as constraints imposed by the interaction with environment. A more precise study of biofilm dynamics requires tackling water absorption from its surroundings and fluid transport within the biological system.

A critical aspect of AMP functionality is their targeted interaction with pathogen membranes, which often possess altered lipid compositions. Designing AMPs with enhanced therapeutic properties relies on a nuanced understanding of these interactions, which are believed to trigger a rearrangement of these peptides from random coil to alpha-helical conformations, essential for their lytic action. Traditional supercomputing has consistently encountered difficulties in accurately modeling these structural changes, especially within membrane environments, thereby opening an opportunity for more advanced approaches. This study extends an existing quantum computing algorithm to address the complexities of antimicrobial peptide interactions at interfaces. Our approach enables the prediction of the optimal conformation of peptides located in the transition region between hydrophilic and hydrophobic phases, akin to lipid membranes. The new method has been applied to model the structure of three 10-amino-acid-long peptides, each exhibiting hydrophobic, hydrophilic, or amphipathic properties in different media and at interfaces between solvents of different polarity. Notably, our approach does not demand a higher number of qubits compared to simulations in homogeneous media, making it more feasible with current quantum computing resources. Despite existing limitations in computational power and qubit accessibility, our findings demonstrate the significant potential of quantum computing in accurately characterizing complex biomolecular processes, particularly the folding of AMPs at membrane models.

This retrospective study enrolled ten treatment-naive patients with radiologically confirmed glioma (5 WHO grade II, 5 WHO grade IV). Each patient underwent a multiparametric MR scan (T1W, T1W-CE, T2W, T2W-FLAIR, DWI) prior to surgery (27.9+/-34.0 days). During standard craniotomy procedure, at least 1 stereotactic biopsy was collected from each patient, with screenshots of the sample locations saved for spatial registration to pre-surgical MR data. Whole-exome sequencing was performed on flash-frozen tumor samples, prioritizing the signatures of five glioma-related genes: IDH1, TP53, EGFR, PIK3CA, & NF1. Regression was implemented with a GAM using a univariate shape function for each predictor. Standard receiver operating characteristic analyses were used to evaluate detection, with AUC (area under curve) calculated for each gene target & MR contrast combination. The mean AUC for the five gene targets & 31 MR contrast combinations was 0.75+/-0.11; individual AUCs were as high as 0.96 for both IDH1 & TP53 with T2W-FLAIR & ADC & 0.99 for EGFR with T2W & ADC.

While amplitude encoding is optimal for a limited range of stimuli strengths around a finite value, frequency encoding information transmission can improve or remain relatively flat as the stimulus strength increases. The apparently redundant combination of both mechanisms in some cell types may then serve the purpose of expanding the range over which stimulus strengths can be reliably discriminated.

When a new variant emerges in one or more countries, other nations monitor its spread in preparation for its potential arrival. The impact of the variant and the timing of epidemic peaks in a country highly depend on when the variant arrives. The current methods for predicting the spread of new variants rely on statistical modeling, however, these methods work only when the new variant has already arrived in the region of interest and has a significant prevalence. The question arises: Can we predict when (and if) a variant that exists elsewhere will arrive in a given country and reach a certain prevalence? We propose a variant-dynamics-informed Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach. First, We derive the dynamics of variant prevalence across pairs of regions (countries) that applies to a large class of epidemic models. The dynamics suggest that ratios of variant proportions lead to simpler patterns. Therefore, we use ratios of variant proportions along with some parameters estimated from the dynamics as features in a GNN. We develop a benchmarking tool to evaluate variant emergence prediction over 87 countries and 36 variants. We leverage this tool to compare our GNN-based approach against our dynamics-only model and a number of machine learning models. Results show that the proposed dynamics-informed GNN method retrospectively outperforms all the baselines, including the currently pervasive framework of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) that incorporates the dynamics in the loss function.","Sun, 7 Jan 2024 05:03:30 UTC (2,615 KB)"

To explore the portion of cellular metabolism equipped with multiple pathways, we categorize individual metabolic reactions and compounds as viable or inviable: A compound is viable if processed by two or more reactions, and a reaction is viable if all of its substrates and products are viable. Using this classification, we identify the maximal subnetwork of viable nodes, referred to as the {\it viable core}, in bipartite metabolic networks across thousands of species. The obtained viable cores are remarkably larger than those in degree-preserving randomized networks, while their broad degree distributions commonly enable the viable cores to shrink gradually as reaction nodes are deleted. We demonstrate that the positive degree-degree correlations of the empirical networks may underlie the enlarged viable cores compared to the randomized networks. By investigating the relation between degree and cross-species frequency of metabolic compounds and reactions, we elucidate the evolutionary origin of the correlations.","Fri, 5 Jan 2024 04:02:07 UTC (1,684 KB)"

Classical computational methods to sample rare events remain prohibitively inefficient, and are a bottleneck for enhanced samplers requiring prior data. Here, we introduce a novel framework, FlowRES that uses unsupervised normalising flow neural networks to enhance Monte Carlo sampling of rare events by generating high-quality nonlocal Monte Carlo proposals. We validate FlowRES by sampling the transition path ensembles of equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems of Brownian particles exploring increasingly complex potential surfaces. Beyond eliminating requirements for prior data, FlowRES features key advantages over established samplers: no collective variables need defining, its efficiency remains constant even as events become increasingly unlikely, and it can handle systems with multiple routes between states.","Tue, 2 Jan 2024 07:11:27 UTC (14,342 KB)"

Networks trained under this theory also show enhanced performance in classifying natural images, achieving higher accuracy and faster inference speed.

Pace, Siavash Ahrar","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","The life cycle of most marine invertebrates includes a planktonic larval stage before metamorphosis to bottom-dwelling adulthood. During larval stage, ciliary-mediated activity enables feeding (capture unicellular algae) and transport of materials (oxygen) required for the larva's growth, development, and successful metamorphosis. Investigating the underlying hydrodynamics of these behaviors is valuable for addressing fundamental biological questions (e.g., phenotypic plasticity) and advancing engineering applications. In this work, we combined microfluidics and fluorescence microscopy as a miniaturized PIV (mPIV) to study ciliary-medicated hydrodynamics during suspension feeding in sand dollar larvae (Dendraster excentricus). First, we confirmed the approach's feasibility by examining the underlying hydrodynamics (vortex patterns) for low- and high-fed larvae. Next, ciliary hydrodynamics were tracked from 11 days post-fertilization (DPF) to 20 DPF for 21 low-fed larvae. Microfluidics enabled the examination of baseline activities (without external flow) and behaviors in the presence of environmental cues (external flow). A library of qualitative vortex patterns and quantitative hydrodynamics was generated and shared as a stand alone repository. Results from mPIV (velocities) were used to examine the role of ciliary activity in transporting materials (oxygen). Given the laminar flow and the viscosity-dominated environments surrounding the larvae, overcoming the diffusive boundary layer is critical for the organism's survival. Peclet number analysis for oxygen transport suggested that ciliary velocities help overcome the diffusion dominated transport (max Pe numbers between 30-60). Microfluidics serving as mPIV provided a scalable and accessible approach for investigating the ciliary hydrodynamics of marine organisms.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 19:23:58 UTC (57,758 KB)"

Concretely, discrete positional markers such as the peaks in striped patterns have absolute positions along the anterior-posterior axis that are proportional to embryo length, with better than 1% accuracy. Further, the information (in bits) that graded patterns of expression provide about position can be decomposed into information about fractional or scaled position and information about absolute position or embryo length; all of the available information is about scaled position, again with ~1% accuracy. These observations suggest that the underlying genetic network exhibits scale invariance in a deeper mathematical sense.

Recently, many mono-modal deep learning methods have been successfully applied to molecular property prediction. However, the inherent limitation of mono-modal learning arises from relying solely on one modality of molecular representation, which restricts a comprehensive understanding of drug molecules and hampers their resilience against data noise. To overcome the limitations, we construct multimodal deep learning models to cover different molecular representations. We convert drug molecules into three molecular representations, SMILES-encoded vectors, ECFP fingerprints, and molecular graphs. To process the modal information, Transformer-Encoder, bi-directional gated recurrent units (BiGRU), and graph convolutional network (GCN) are utilized for feature learning respectively, which can enhance the model capability to acquire complementary and naturally occurring bioinformatics information. We evaluated our triple-modal model on six molecule datasets. Different from bi-modal learning models, we adopt five fusion methods to capture the specific features and leverage the contribution of each modal information better. Compared with mono-modal models, our multimodal fused deep learning (MMFDL) models outperform single models in accuracy, reliability, and resistance capability against noise. Moreover, we demonstrate its generalization ability in the prediction of binding constants for protein-ligand complex molecules in the refined set of PDBbind. The advantage of the multimodal model lies in its ability to process diverse sources of data using proper models and suitable fusion methods, which would enhance the noise resistance of the model while obtaining data diversity.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 07:19:42 UTC (1,666 KB)"

The receptors control the activity of histidine kinase CheA, which drives a non-equilibrium phosphorylation-dephosphorylation reaction cycle for response regulator CheY. Recent single-cell FRET measurements revealed that kinase activity of the array spontaneously switches between active and inactive states, with asymmetric switching times that signify time-reversal symmetry breaking in the underlying dynamics. Here, we show that the asymmetric switching dynamics can be explained by a non-equilibrium lattice model, which considers both the dissipative reaction cycles of individual core units and the coupling between neighboring units. The model reveals that large dissipation and near-critical coupling are required to explain the observed switching dynamics. Microscopically, the switching time asymmetry originates from irreversible transition paths. The model shows that strong dissipation enables sensitive and rapid signaling response by relieving the speed-sensitivity trade-off, which can be tested by future single-cell experiments. Overall, our model provides a general framework for studying biological complexes composed of coupled subunits that are individually driven by dissipative cycles and the rich non-equilibrium physics within.","Fri, 29 Dec 2023 01:36:43 UTC (8,536 KB)"

In addition, the visual information represented is subsampled. On the other hand, the methods used to assess image quality of x-ray systems performing detectability tasks are usually carried out in the spatial or image domain. This study examines the behavior of two observers, IBO and NPW, employed in the evaluation of imaging systems, in a domain that simulates the representation of visual information in V1 to gain a better understanding of the degree of optimization in human observer detectability tasks. The comparison of the two observers is conducted on images of a contrast-detail phantom and is performed in both the spatial and the wavelet domains. Furthermore, the study examines the covariance matrices of the noise. The strong covariance exhibited in the noise among neighboring pixels in the spatial domain results in covariance matrices with relatively high values outside the main diagonal, leading to significant differences between the NPW and IBO observers. In the transformed domain, the band-pass decimated filters have substantially reduced the covariance between neighboring pixels, resulting in the convergence of the detectability indices of both observers. The vast amount of information captured by the retina necessitates an optimization of informational nature. This strategy eliminates low-frequency correlations in the image, after bandpass filtering carried out by simple cells in V1. This loss of information could contribute to the suboptimal performance of the human observer. Interestingly, in V1 the differences between IBO and NPW observers are very small. Therefore, either NPW does not accurately represent the human observer in V1, or the human observer is close to optimal in this domain.","Thu, 28 Dec 2023 21:24:14 UTC (8,457 KB)"

The model considers a regular (two-dimensional) network of structural elements mimicking a discrete number of parallel collagen lamellae connected by proteoglycan-based chemical bonds (crosslinks). Since the thickness of each collagen lamella is small compared to the overall corneal thickness, we upscale the discrete force balance into a continuum system of partial differential equations and deduce the corresponding macroscopic stress tensor and strain energy function for the micro-structured corneal tissue. We demonstrate that, for physiological values of the IOP, the predictions of the discrete model converge to those of the continuum model. We use the continuum model to simulate the progression of the degenerative disease known as keratoconus, characterized by a localized bulging of the corneal shell. We assign a spatial distribution of damage (i. e., reduction of the stiffness) to the mechanical properties of the structural elements and predict the resulting macroscopic shape of the cornea, showing that a large reduction in the element stiffness results in substantial corneal thinning and a significant increase in the curvature of both the anterior and posterior surfaces.","Sat, 23 Dec 2023 01:54:08 UTC (2,522 KB)"

This study, on the other hand, introduces the first experimental study of a novel iCT approach based on time-of-flight (TOF) measurements, the so-called Sandwich TOF-iCT concept, which in contrast to any other iCT system, does not require a residual energy detector for the RSP determination. A small TOF-iCT demonstrator was built based on low gain avalanche diodes (LGAD), which are 4D-tracking detectors that allow to simultaneously measure the particle position and time-of-arrival with a precision better than 100um and 100ps, respectively. Using this demonstrator, the material and energy-dependent TOF was measured for several homogeneous PMMA slabs in order to calibrate the acquired TOF against the corresponding water equivalent thickness (WET). With this calibration, two proton radiographs (pRad) of a small aluminium stair phantom were recorded at MedAustron using 83 and 100.4MeV protons. Due to the simplified WET calibration models used in this very first experimental study of this novel approach, the difference between the measured and theoretical WET ranged between 37.09 and 51.12%. Nevertheless, the first TOF-based pRad was successfully recorded showing that LGADs are suitable detector candidates for TOF-iCT. While the system parameters and WET estimation algorithms require further optimization, this work was an important first step to realize Sandwich TOF-iCT.

The Minority Game is perhaps the simplest model that provides deep insights into how human coordinate to maximize the resource utilization. However, this model assumes the static strategies that are provided a priori, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we turn to the paradigm of reinforcement learning, where individuals' strategies are evolving by evaluating both the past experience and rewards in the future. Specifically, we adopt the Q-learning algorithm, each player is endowed with a Q-table that guides their decision-making. We reveal that the population is able to reach the optimal allocation when individuals appreciate both the past experience and rewards in the future, and they are able to balance the exploitation of their Q-tables and the exploration by randomly acting. The optimal allocation is ruined when individuals tend to use either exploitation-only or exploration-only, where only partial coordination and even anti-coordination are observed. Mechanism analysis reveals that a moderate level of exploration can escape local minimums of metastable periodic states, and reaches the optimal coordination as the global minimum. Interestingly, the optimal coordination is underlined by a symmetry-breaking of action preferences, where nearly half of the population choose one side while the other half prefer the other side. The emergence of optimal coordination is robust to the population size and other game parameters. Our work therefore provides a natural solution to the Minority Game and sheds insights into the resource allocation problem in general. Besides, our work demonstrates the potential of the proposed reinforcement learning paradigm in deciphering many puzzles in the socio-economic context.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 00:47:45 UTC (980 KB)"

The wave dynamics are typically modeled using coupled partial differential equations, which describe reaction-diffusion dynamics in excitable media. More recently, data-driven generative modeling has emerged as an alternative to generate spatio-temporal patterns in physical and biological systems. Here, we explore denoising diffusion probabilistic models for the generative modeling of electrical wave patterns in cardiac tissue. We trained diffusion models with simulated electrical wave patterns to be able to generate such wave patterns in unconditional and conditional generation tasks. For instance, we explored inpainting tasks, such as reconstructing three-dimensional wave dynamics from superficial two-dimensional measurements, and evolving and generating parameter-specific dynamics. We characterized and compared the diffusion-generated solutions to solutions obtained with biophysical models and found that diffusion models learn to replicate spiral and scroll waves dynamics so well that they could serve as an alternative data-driven approach for the modeling of excitation waves in cardiac tissue. For instance, we found that it is possible to initiate ventricular fibrillation (VF) dynamics instantaneously without having to apply pacing protocols in order to induce wavebreak. The VF dynamics can be created in arbitrary ventricular geometries and can be evolved over time. However, we also found that diffusion models `hallucinate' wave patterns when given insufficient constraints. Regardless of these limitations, diffusion models are an interesting and powerful tool with many potential applications in cardiac arrhythmia research and diagnostics.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 17:06:08 UTC (3,469 KB)"

However, microbial populations generally evolve in volatile environments, yielding sudden changes in the available amount of nutrients and toxins. These, together with demographic fluctuations (birth and death events), have been recognised to drastically alter the population size and strain coexistence, as well as the ability of one strain to fixate and take over the entire population. Motivated by the need to better understand the evolution of AMR, we study a population of time-varying size consisting of two competing strains, one drug-resistant and one drug-sensitive, subject to demographic and environmental variability. This is modelled by a binary carrying capacity randomly switching between mild and harsh environmental conditions, and driving the fluctuating volume (total amount of nutrients and antimicrobials at fixed concentration), and thus the size of the community (number of resistant and sensitive cells). We assume that AMR is a shared public good when the concentration of resistant cells exceeds a fixed ""concentration cooperation threshold"", above which the sensitive strain has a growth advantage, whereas resistant cells dominate below it. Using computational means, and devising an analytical treatment (built on suitable quenched and annealed averaging procedures), we fully characterise the influence of fluctuations on the eco-evolutionary dynamics of AMR, and notably obtain specific strain fixation and long-lasting coexistence probabilities as a function of the environmental variation rate and cooperation threshold.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 16:58:48 UTC (1,746 KB)"

In our model, susceptible individuals can be quarantined up to $n$ times, after which they stop complying with quarantine orders due to fatigue. Our results show that quarantine fatigue may induce a regime in which increasing the probability of detecting and isolating infected individuals (along with their close contacts) could subsequently increase the expected number of cases at the end of an outbreak. Moreover, we observe that quarantine fatigue can trigger an abrupt phase transition at the critical reproduction number $R_0=1$. Finally, we explore a scenario where a non-negligible number of individuals are infected at the beginning of an epidemic, and our results show that, depending on the value of $n$, an abrupt transition between a controlled epidemic and a large epidemic event can occur for $R_0<1$.","Fri, 22 Dec 2023 14:04:47 UTC (5,030 KB)"

In principle, shifting both the excitation as well as (fluorescence) emission light to the shortwave near-infrared (SWIR, 1000-1700 nm) region promises substantially deeper imaging in 2PM, yet has proven challenging in the past due to the limited availability of detectors and probes in this wavelength region.

Smith, Blanca Rodriguez, Yuling Sang, Marcel Beetz, Robin Choudhury, Vicente Grau, Abhirup Banerjee","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","The electrocardiogram (ECG) is routinely used in cardiology, though its interpretation is confounded by anatomical variability. A novel, automated computational pipeline enables quantification of torso-ventricular anatomy metrics from magnetic resonance imaging, and comparison to ECG characteristics. Sex and myocardial infarction differences are investigated based on 1051 healthy and 425 post-MI subjects from UK Biobank. Smaller ventricles in females explain ~50% of shorter QRS durations than in males, and contribute to lower STJ amplitudes in females (also due to more superior and posterior position). In females, torso-ventricular anatomy, particularly from larger BMI, is a stronger modulator of T wave amplitude reductions and left-deviated R axis angles in post-MI than in males. Thus, female MI phenotype is less reflective of pathology, and baseline STJ amplitudes and QRS durations are further from clinical thresholds. Therefore, quantification of anatomical sex-differences and impact on ECG in health and disease is critical to avoid clinical sex-bias.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 16:03:56 UTC (2,996 KB)"

However, performing simulations for large systems and in the case of strong electron correlation remains challenging. Quantum computers are poised to facilitate the simulation of such systems, and recently, a quantum linear response formulation (qLR) was introduced. To apply qLR to near-term quantum computers beyond a minimal basis set, we here introduce a resource-efficient qLR theory using a truncated active-space version of the multi-configurational self-consistent field LR ansatz. Therein, we investigate eight different near-term qLR formalisms that utilize novel operator transformations that allow the qLR equations to be performed on near-term hardware.

The most stablished theory of neuronal communication is a pure electrical model based on the propagation of intracell cationic charges along the neurons. Here we propose a complementary model based on two properties of brain communication: A) The large Coulomb repulsion within the intracell Na+ cation pulse at the Action Potential (AP) induces a deformation of the neuron membrane which travels as an acoustic signal, i.e.: the intracell ion pulse makes both the electric and acoustic signals be strongly correlated. B) As brain communication is stablished through a periodic train of AP pulses it induces a time periodic modulation of the acoustic parameters. In this framework we propose envisaging the neuron as a temporal electro-acoustic medium. The temporal varying media framework could help understanding brain conundrums such as propagation routes involved in the neuronal plasticity in the consolidation of the memory, as well as on the generation of the signals associated to the brain field theory.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 11:29:15 UTC (406 KB)"

Many models of biological invasion are extensions of the Fisher-KPP model that describes the evolution of a 1D population density as a result of linear diffusion and logistic growth. In 2020 Fadai introduced a new model of biological invasion that was formulated as a moving boundary problem with a nonlinear degenerate diffusive flux. Fadai's model leads to travelling wave solutions with infinitely steep, well-defined fronts at the moving boundary, and the model has the mathematical advantage of being analytically tractable in certain parameter limits. We aim to provide general insight by first presenting two key extensions by considering: (i) generalised nonlinear degenerate diffusion with flux; and, (ii) solutions describing both biological invasion, and biological recession. We establish the existence of travelling wave solutions for these two extensions, and then consider stability of the travelling wave solutions by introducing a lateral perturbation of the travelling wavefront. Full 2D time-dependent level-set numerical solutions indicate that invasive travelling waves are stable to small lateral perturbations, whereas receding travelling waves are unstable. These preliminary numerical observations are corroborated through a linear stability analysis that gives more formal insight into short time growth/decay of wavefront perturbation amplitude.","Thu, 21 Dec 2023 06:24:15 UTC (6,673 KB)[v2] Sat, 6 Jan 2024 01:36:31 UTC (6,674 KB)"

Molecules inherently exist in the real world as three-dimensional structures; furthermore, they are not static but in continuous motion in the 3D Euclidean space, forming a potential energy surface. Therefore, it is desirable to generate multiple conformations in advance and extract molecular representations using a 4D-QSAR model that incorporates multiple conformations. However, this approach is impractical for drug and material discovery tasks because of the computational cost of obtaining multiple conformations. To address this issue, we propose a pre-training method for molecular GNNs using an existing dataset of molecular conformations to generate a latent vector universal to multiple conformations from a 2D molecular graph. Our method, called Boltzmann GNN, is formulated by maximizing the conditional marginal likelihood of a conditional generative model for conformations generation. We show that our model has a better prediction performance for molecular properties than existing pre-training methods using molecular graphs and three-dimensional molecular structures.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 15:30:15 UTC (722 KB)[v2] Sun, 31 Dec 2023 06:47:40 UTC (721 KB)[v3] Thu, 18 Jan 2024 22:28:06 UTC (718 KB)"

Schmidt, Andrea J. Liu","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","Dorsal closure is a process that occurs during embryogenesis of Drosophila melanogaster. During dorsal closure, the amnioserosa (AS), a one-cell thick epithelial tissue that fills the dorsal opening, shrinks as the lateral epidermis sheets converge and eventually merge. During this process, the aspect ratio of amnioserosa cells increases markedly. The standard 2-dimensional vertex model, which successfully describes tissue sheet mechanics in multiple contexts, would in this case predict that the tissue should fluidize via cell neighbor changes. Surprisingly, however, the amnioserosa remains an elastic solid with no such events. We here present a minimal extension to the vertex model that explains how the amnioserosa can achieve this unexpected behavior. We show that continuous shrinkage of the preferred cell perimeter and cell perimeter polydispersity lead to the retention of the solid state of the amnioserosa. Our model accurately captures measured cell shape and orientation changes and predicts non-monotonic junction tension that we confirm with laser ablation experiments.","Wed, 20 Dec 2023 10:59:46 UTC (1,257 KB)"

However, migrating cells are often able to overcome this limitation and pass through constrictions much smaller than their nucleus, a mechanism that is not yet understood. This is what we address here through a data-driven approach using microfluidic devices where cells migrate through controlled narrow spaces of sizes comparable to the ones encountered in physiological situations. Stochastic Force Inference is applied to experimental nuclear trajectories and nuclear shape descriptors, resulting in equations that effectively describe this phenomenon of nuclear translocation. By employing a model where the channel geometry is an explicit parameter and by training it over experimental data with different sizes of constrictions, we ensure that the resulting equations are predictive to other geometries. Altogether, the approach developed here paves the way for a mechanistic and quantitative description of dynamical cell complexity during its motility.","Tue, 19 Dec 2023 18:36:42 UTC (4,982 KB)"

One class of such emergent behaviors, important to biological functions such as body-axis elongation, involves rigidity transitions, in which a tissue changes from a fluid-like state to a solid-like state or vice versa. Here, we explore the idea that tissues might tune ``learning degrees of freedom"" to affect this emergent behavior. We study tissue fluidity in the 2D vertex model, using the vertex model energy as a learning cost function and the cell stiffnesses, target shapes, and target areas as sets of learning degrees of freedom that can be varied to minimize the energy. We show that the rigidity transition is unaffected when cell stiffnesses are treated as learning degrees of freedom. When preferred perimeters or areas are treated as learning degrees of freedom, however, energy minimization introduces spatial correlations in target cell shapes or areas that shift the rigidity transition. There is an optimal heterogeneity of target cell shapes or areas to enable learning. These observations suggest that biological tissues can learn tissue-scale behaviors by tuning their individual cell properties.","Mon, 18 Dec 2023 20:03:39 UTC (7,332 KB)[v2] Fri, 22 Dec 2023 16:12:26 UTC (7,332 KB)[v3] Sun, 7 Jan 2024 21:17:34 UTC (7,332 KB)"

We present a probabilistic model for ipsilateral lymphatic spread that can quantify the microscopic nodal involvement risk based on an individual patient's T-category and clinical involvement of LNLs at diagnosis. We extend a previously published hidden Markov model (HMM), which models the LNLs (I, II, III, IV, V, and VII) as hidden binary random variables (RVs). Each represents a patient's true state of lymphatic involvement. Clinical involvement at diagnosis represents the observed binary RVs linked to the true state via sensitivity and specificity. The primary tumor and the hidden RVs are connected in a graph. Each edge represents the conditional probability of metastatic spread per abstract time-step, given disease at the edge's starting node. To learn these probabilities, we draw Markov chain Monte Carlo samples from the likelihood of a dataset (686 OPSCC patients) from three institutions. We compute the model evidence using thermodynamic integration for different graphs to determine which describes the data best. The graph maximizing the model evidence connects the tumor to each LNL and the LNLs I through V in order. It predicts the risk of occult disease in level IV is below 5% if level III is clinically negative, and that the risk of occult disease in level V is below 5% except for advanced T-category (T3 and T4) patients with clinical involvement of levels II, III, and IV.

Plotkin","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Social reputations facilitate cooperation: those who help others gain a good reputation, making them more likely to receive help themselves. But when people hold private views of one another, this cycle of indirect reciprocity breaks down, as disagreements lead to the perception of unjustified behavior that ultimately undermines cooperation. Theoretical studies often assume population-wide agreement about reputations, invoking rapid gossip as an endogenous mechanism for reaching consensus. However, the theory of indirect reciprocity lacks a mechanistic description of how gossip actually generates consensus. Here we develop a mechanistic model of gossip-based indirect reciprocity that incorporates two alternative forms of gossip: exchanging information with randomly selected peers or consulting a single gossip source. We show that these two forms of gossip are mathematically equivalent under an appropriate transformation of parameters. We derive an analytical expression for the minimum amount of gossip required to reach sufficient consensus and stabilize cooperation. We analyze how the amount of gossip necessary for cooperation depends on the benefits and costs of cooperation, the assessment rule (social norm), and errors in reputation assessment, strategy execution, and gossip transmission. Finally, we show that biased gossip can either facilitate or hinder cooperation, depending on the direction and magnitude of the bias. Our results contribute to the growing literature on cooperation facilitated by communication, and they highlight the need to study strategic interactions coupled with the spread of social information.","Sun, 17 Dec 2023 21:37:15 UTC (1,597 KB)"

We demonstrate how a subnational approach could achieve similar level of epidemiological control in terms of hospital admissions, while some parts of the country could stay open for a longer period.

Staniczenko, Debabrata Panja","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","Nestedness is a common property of communication, finance, trade, and ecological networks. In networks with high levels of nestedness, the link positions of low-degree nodes (those with few links) form nested subsets of the link positions of high-degree nodes (those with many links), leading to matrix representations with characteristic upper-triangular or staircase patterns. Recent theoretical work has connected nestedness to the functionality of complex systems and has suggested it is a structural by-product of the skewed degree distributions often seen in empirical data. However, mechanisms for generating nestedness remain poorly understood, limiting the connections that can be made between system processes and observed network structures. Here, we show that a simple probabilistic model based on phenology -- the timing of co-presences among interaction partners -- can produce nested structures and correctly predict around two-thirds of interactions in two fish market networks and around one-third of interactions in 22 plant-pollinator networks. Notably, the links most readily explained by frequent actor co-presences appear to form a backbone of nested interactions, with the remaining interactions attributable to opportunistic interactions or preferences for particular interaction partners that are not routinely available.","Sun, 17 Dec 2023 17:22:42 UTC (1,396 KB)"

Here, we link the evolutionary history of eukaryotes with the rise and fall of carbonate rock fraction within continental crust - a key variable in controlling the efficiency of carbon drawdown during weathering, solid Earth degassing rates, and ultimately nutrient supply to life. We use geospatial database analyses to demonstrate a strongly non-linear growth and then collapse in Earth's continental crust carbonate reservoir. Biomineralisers reshaped Earth's surface in their image; armouring continental margins with carbonate platforms, such that the continental carbonate reservoir increased in size by 5-fold in under 100 Myr after the Cambrian Radiation of animal life. This Paleozoic carbonate revolution represents among the most dramatic crustal evolutionary events in Earth's history. The Permo-Triassic extinction event coupled to the rise of open ocean calcifiers initiated a steady decline in continental crustal carbonate content; one that still continues today, which unabated would produce Precambrian-style crustal carbonate distributions in around 500-1000 Myr. Our results demonstrate strongly non-linear crustal evolution after the rise of the complex Phanerozoic biosphere.

Trajectories can then be generated using a refined version of the Gillespie algorithm. We illustrate the benefits of our method by sampling trajectories in the Müller-Brown potential. This allows us to generate transition paths which would otherwise be obtained at a high computational cost with standard Kinetic Monte Carlo methods because commitment to a transition path is essentially a rare event. We then apply our method to a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset from mouse pancreatic cells to investigate the cell differentiation pathways of endocrine-cell precursors. By sampling Markov bridges for a specific differentiation pathway we obtain a time-resolved dynamics that can reveal features such as cell types which behave as bottlenecks.

Furthermore, recent developments have established a tip-scan stand-alone HS-AFM that can be combined with an optical microscope, drastically improving its versatility for studying various complex phenomena. Although HS-AFM has mainly been used in biology, it has considerable potential to contribute to various research fields. One of the great candidates is a photoactive material, such as an azo-polymer, which plays a vital role in multiple optical applications because of its unique nanoscale motion under light irradiation. In this study, we demonstrate the in-situ real-time observation of nanoscale azo-polymer motion by combining tip-scan HS-AFM with an optical system, allowing HS-AFM observations precisely aligned with a tightly focused laser position. We successfully observed the dynamic evolution of unique morphologies in azo-polymer films, attributed to photoinduced nano-movements. Moreover, real-time topographic line profile analyses facilitated precise and quantitative investigations of morphological changes, which provided novel insights into the deformation mechanism. This significant demonstration would pave the way for the application of HS-AFM in wide research fields, from biology to material science and physical chemistry.","Tue, 12 Dec 2023 07:35:42 UTC (2,191 KB)"
"149","The role of ion channels in the transmission of signals along axons","Lízia Maria Gonçalves Branco, Rui Manuel Agostinho Dilão","Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC)","This work proposes a two-dimensional electrophysiological model for describing neuronal responses to external electric stimuli under patch-clamped conditions. Our proposed model successfully captures the key features of the Hodgkin-Huxley model, while offering improved informativeness and numerical efficiency. By analysing bifurcation diagrams from various reduced models, we describe the contributions of different ionic channels to the stability or instability of the neurones' response. We also explore the influence of various cell parameters in the neurone's spiking frequency, including the membrane capacitance and the ionic channels' conductivities and Nerst potentials. Additionally, we suggest a spatial model for the axon that effectively simulates unidirectional signal transmission along neurons unaffected by membrane potential perturbations. After analysing the characteristics of this compartmental model, including the impact of intracellular resistance and membrane capacitance on the signal's velocity, we observed considerable discrepancies between our findings and those predicted by the cable equation model for signal propagation. Moreover, our investigation reveals that when the transmission of neuronal signals occurs in multiple peaks, there is a transient variation in their wavelength and frequency, resulting in different peak velocities. Furthermore, our findings consistently demonstrate that the first peak - in some cases, the only peak observed - maintains a relatively constant velocity along the axon regardless of the stimulus intensity and is always faster than the subsequent peaks.","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 19:06:40 UTC (3,666 KB)"
"150","Radical pairs and superoxide amplification can explain magnetic field effects on planarian regeneration","Rishabh, Hadi Zadeh-Haghighi, Christoph Simon","Biological Physics (physics.bio-ph)","Weak magnetic field exposure can affect many biological processes across a wide range of living organisms. Recently, it has been observed that weak magnetic fields can modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) concentration, affecting regeneration in planaria. These effects show unusual nonlinear dependence on magnetic field strength, including a sign change. In another study by the same group, superoxide is identified as the particular ROS being modulated. We propose a radical pair mechanism based on a flavin-superoxide radical pair to explain the modulation of superoxide production and its effect on planarian regeneration. The results of our calculations favor a triplet-born radical pair. Our yield calculations can reproduce the observed magnetic field dependence, including the sign change. Moreover, to explain the size of the effect on ROS concentration, we suggest a simple amplification model inspired by known biochemical mechanisms and lay out the conditions for such a model to work. Further, we also make empirical predictions concerning the hypomagnetic field effects on planarian regeneration.","Mon, 11 Dec 2023 18:31:01 UTC (7,534 KB)"
