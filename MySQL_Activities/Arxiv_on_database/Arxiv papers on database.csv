"1","Operator Learning Renormalization Group","Xiu-Zhe Luo, Di Luo, Roger G. Melko","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","In this paper, we present a general framework for quantum many-body simulations called the operator learning renormalization group (OLRG). Inspired by machine learning perspectives, OLRG is a generalization of Wilson's numerical renormalization group and White's density matrix renormalization group, which recursively builds a simulatable system to approximate a target system of the same number of sites via operator maps. OLRG uses a loss function to minimize the error of a target property directly by learning the operator map in lieu of a state ansatz. This loss function is designed by a scaling consistency condition that also provides a provable bound for real-time evolution. We implement two versions of the operator maps for classical and quantum simulations. The former, which we call the Operator Matrix Map, can be implemented via neural networks on classical computers. The latter, which we call the Hamiltonian Expression Map, generates device pulse sequences to leverage the capabilities of quantum computing hardware. We illustrate the performance of both maps for calculating time-dependent quantities in the quantum Ising model Hamiltonian.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 18:37:37 UTC (4,196 KB)"
"2","Hybrid data assimilation techniques using the adjoint method in a coupled Lorenz system","Philip David Kennedy, Abhirup Banerjee, Armin Köhl, Detlef Stammer","Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)","A hybrid 4D-variational data assimilation method for numerical climate models is introduced using the Lorenz '63 model. This new approach has the potential to optimise a high complexity Earth system model (ESM) by utilising the adjoint equations of an intermediate complexity ESM. The method is conceptually demonstrated by consecutively synchronising two Lorenz '63 systems to observations before optimisation. The first represents a 'high complexity' model and the second an 'intermediate complexity' model which has adjoint equations. This method will save computational power for a full ESM and has negligible error and uncertainty change compared to the optimisation of a single model with adjoint equations. A similar setup can be applied to sparse observations. An alternative assimilation setup, with two identical models, is used to filter noisy data. This reduces optimised parametric model uncertainty by approximately one third. Such a precision gain could prove valuable for seasonal, annual, and decadal predictions.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 17:58:32 UTC (1,751 KB)"

Their applications span diverse physical systems, including telecommunications, atomic clocks, and precise measurements. In recent years, significant strides have been made in developing cavity-optomechanics based approaches to generate optical frequency combs (FCs). In this study, we present an innovative approach, never explored before, that leverages elastomer membrane (EM)-cavity optomechanics to achieve the generation of soliton FCs, a highly sought-after phenomenon in the realm of nonlinear wave-matter interactions. Our method represents a significant breakthrough due to its streamlined simplicity, relying on a single continuous-wave (CW) laser pump and an externally applied acoustic wave exciting an EM-cavity, which gives rise to phonons, quantized vibrational energy states intrinsic to the elastomer's crystalline lattice structure. The mechanical resonator and electromagnetic cavity resonance are parametrically coupled within the microwave frequency range, collectively orchestrate the process of soliton FCs formation with remarkable efficiency. Numerical simulations and experimental observations demonstrate the emergence of multiple stable localized opto-mechanical wave packets, characterized by a narrow pulses time-domain response. Crucially, by setting the acoustic wave frequency to match the natural frequency of the EM resonator, the solitons' teeth are precisely spaced, and the EM's motion is significantly amplified, giving rise to a Kerr medium. The successful realization of optomechanical stable solitons represents a monumental advancement with transformative potential across various fields, including quantum computing and spectroscopy.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 17:54:03 UTC (2,088 KB)"

Brenner, Eun-Ah Kim","Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)","Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated an unprecedented ability to perform complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific reasoning. We demonstrate that with carefully designed prompts, LLMs can accurately carry out key calculations in research papers in theoretical physics. We focus on a broadly used approximation method in quantum physics: the Hartree-Fock method, requiring an analytic multi-step calculation deriving approximate Hamiltonian and corresponding self-consistency equations. To carry out the calculations using LLMs, we design multi-step prompt templates that break down the analytic calculation into standardized steps with placeholders for problem-specific information. We evaluate GPT-4's performance in executing the calculation for 15 research papers from the past decade, demonstrating that, with correction of intermediate steps, it can correctly derive the final Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian in 13 cases and makes minor errors in 2 cases. Aggregating across all research papers, we find an average score of 87.5 (out of 100) on the execution of individual calculation steps. Overall, the requisite skill for doing these calculations is at the graduate level in quantum condensed matter theory. We further use LLMs to mitigate the two primary bottlenecks in this evaluation process: (i) extracting information from papers to fill in templates and (ii) automatic scoring of the calculation steps, demonstrating good results in both cases. The strong performance is the first step for developing algorithms that automatically explore theoretical hypotheses at an unprecedented scale.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 17:47:22 UTC (4,051 KB)"

It is therefore important to understand what factors determine people's vaccination decisions. To this end, previous behavioural research made use of, (i) controlled but often abstract or hypothetical studies (e.g., vignettes) or, (ii) realistic but typically less flexible studies that make it difficult to understand individual decision processes (e.g., clinical trials). Combining the best of these approaches, we propose integrating real-world Bluetooth contacts via smartphones in several rounds of a game scenario, as a novel methodology to study vaccination decisions and disease spread. In our 12-week proof-of-concept study conducted with $N$ = 494 students, we found that participants strongly responded to some of the information provided to them during or after each decision round, particularly those related to their individual health outcomes. In contrast, information related to others' decisions and outcomes (e.g., the number of vaccinated or infected individuals) appeared to be less important. We discuss the potential of this novel method and point to fruitful areas for future research.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 17:27:05 UTC (435 KB)"
"6","Fast and robust method for screened Poisson lattice Green's function using asymptotic expansion and Fast Fourier Transform","Wei Hou, Tim Colonius","Numerical Analysis (math.NA)","We study the lattice Green's function (LGF) of the screened Poisson equation on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice. This LGF arises in numerical analysis, random walks, solid-state physics, and other fields. Its defining characteristic is the screening term, which defines different regimes. When its coefficient is large, we can accurately approximate the LGF with an exponentially converging asymptotic expansion, and its convergence rate monotonically increases with the coefficient of the screening term. To tabulate the LGF when the coefficient is not large, we derive a one-dimensional integral representation of the LGF. We show that the trapezoidal rule can approximate this integral with exponential convergence, and we propose an efficient algorithm for its evaluation via the Fast Fourier Transform. We discuss applications including computing the LGF of the three-dimensional Poisson equation with one periodic direction and the return probability of a two-dimensional random walk with killing.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 16:01:28 UTC (339 KB)"

In this work, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach to enhancing the loading of single atoms by introducing a weak ancillary dipole beam. The loading rate of single atoms in a dipole trap can be significantly improved by only a few tens of microwatts of counter-propagating beam. It was also demonstrated that multiple atoms could be loaded with the assistance of a counter-propagating beam. By reducing the power requirements for trapping single atoms and enabling the trapping of multiple atoms, our method facilitates the extension of single-atom arrays and the investigation of collective light-atom interactions.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 15:57:11 UTC (901 KB)"
"8","Interannual Magneto-Coriolis modes and their sensitivity on the magnetic field within the Earth's core","Felix Gerick, Phil Livermore","Geophysics (physics.geo-ph)","Linear modes for which the Coriolis acceleration is almost entirely in balance with the Lorentz force are called Magneto-Coriolis (MC) modes. These MC modes are thought to exist in Earth's liquid outer core and could therefore contribute to the variations observed in Earth's magnetic field. The background state on which these waves ride is assumed here to be static and defined by a prescribed magnetic field and zero flow. We introduce a new computational tool to efficiently compute solutions to the related eigenvalue problem, and study the affect of a range of both axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric background magnetic fields on the MC modes. We focus on a hierarchy of conditions that sequentially partition the numerous computed modes into those which are in principle observable, those which match a proxy for interannual geomagnetic signal over 1999-2023, and those which align with core-flows based on recent geomagnetic data. We found that the background field plays a crucial role in modal structure. In particular, we found no examples of axisymmetric background fields that support modes consistent with recent geomagnetic changes, but that some non-axisymmetric background fields do support consistent modes.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 14:47:02 UTC (21,476 KB)"

Schmidt, Fabian Wolf","Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)","The demand for efficient preparation methods for dual-species ion crystals is rapidly expanding across quantum technology and fundamental physics applications with trapped ions. We present a deterministic and efficient technique to produce such crystals, utilizing the segmented structure of a linear Paul trap. By precisely tailoring the trapping potentials, we can split, move, and discard parts of an ion chain. This process is automated in a sequence that converts a larger ion sample into the desired configuration. A critical component of our approach is the accurate identification of crystal constituents. This is achieved by matching the measured positions of fluorescing ions against theoretical expectations for larger crystals, thus facilitating the detection of non-fluorescing ions and enabling accurate ion counting. We demonstrate that our method reliably produces two-ion crystals within minutes. These results represent a significant advance in the production of two-species ion crystals with applications ranging from quantum logic spectroscopy and optical clocks to quantum computing and simulation with trapped ions.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 14:45:05 UTC (2,829 KB)"

Unlike today's machines, quantum computers use a novel computing process that leverages the foundational quantum mechanical laws of nature. This unlocks unparalleled compute power for certain applications and promises to help solve some of our generation's gravest challenges, including the climate crisis, food insecurity, and widespread disease. No one entity will be able to realize this end state alone. Developing a fault-tolerant quantum supercomputer and a vibrant ecosystem around it will require deep partnerships between industry, governments, and academia. It will also require collective action to enable and promote positive applications of quantum computing and ensure that the safe and responsible use of the technology is at the center of its development and deployment. Achieving these objectives will require focusing on three priorities: 1. Impact. Ensure quantum computing benefits all of humankind by developing quantum solutions to solve critical, global problems. 2. Use. Protect against malicious use by accelerating the deployment of quantum-safe cryptography and developing governance processes and controls for the responsible use of quantum machines. 3. Access. Democratize the potential for economic growth across all of society through skilling, workforce and ecosystem development, and digital infrastructure.

As the drug is released at the time when required, its efficacy is boosted and the side effects are minimized. However, so far, drug delivery devices often rely on the passive diffusion process for a sustained release, which is slow and uncontrollable. Here, we present a miniaturized microfluidic device for wirelessly controlled ultrafast active drug delivery, driven by an oscillating solid-liquid interface. The oscillation generates acoustic streaming in the drug reservoir, which opens an elastic valve to deliver the drug. High-speed microscopy reveals the fast response of the valve on the order of 1 ms, which is more than three orders of magnitude faster than the start-of-the-art. The amount of the released drug exhibits a linear relationship with the working time and the electric power applied to the ultrasonic resonator. The trigger of the release is wirelessly controlled via a magnetic field, and the system shows stable output in a continuous experiment for two weeks. The integrated system shows great promise as a long-term controlled drug delivery implant for chronic diseases.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 12:34:36 UTC (7,878 KB)"
"12","Unlocking Electro-optic Resonant Phase Shifting for Multi-dimensional, Ultra-dynamic Photonic Switches","Lingzhi Luo, Rui Ma, Richard V. Penty, Qixiang Cheng","Optics (physics.optics)","Optical circuit switching is connection-oriented, being deterministic through the reservation of a complete wavelength channel or spatial path for a certain period. However, this comes at a trade-off against link dynamics, and overall capacity can thus be constrained by the time slot reservations, especially for switches with microsecond- to millisecond-scale reconfiguration times. For data-intensive applications, the communication patterns associated with random data sets typically yield short-lived flows. This situation calls for a new multi-dimensional switching paradigm that fully exploits not only the space and wavelength domains but also with nanosecond-scale reconfigurable capability in the time domain to enable ultra-dynamic links. In this work, we focus on the exploitation of micro-ring resonant phase shifters (RPSs) that are wavelength selective for optical switching in a single plane. By proposing an innovative analytical method with transmission circle chart, we fully unlock the power of RPS with nanosecond-scale reconfigurability and the capability to arbitrarily manipulate its phase and amplitude. Such a compact model offers fresh insights into designs with under and critically coupled RPSs beyond the commonly explored over-coupling condition. This creates not only versatile switch elements but also perfect absorbers for robust multi-wavelength operations. The proposed device can bring about a breakthrough in the optical switching capacity that potentially addresses the challenges faced by modern data center networks, as well as other photonic circuits for high-throughput signal processing.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 11:19:43 UTC (1,603 KB)"

While calculations on individual structures as well as on simple relations between them (\textit{e.g.}, as given by an intrinsic reaction coordinate) have become routine in chemistry, new developments have pushed the frontier in the field to high-throughput calculations. Chemical relations may be created by a search for specific molecular properties in a molecular design attempt or they can be defined by a set of elementary reaction steps that form a chemical reaction network. The software modules of SCINE have been designed to facilitate such studies. The features of the modules are (i) general applicability of the applied methodologies ranging from electronic structure (no restriction to specific elements of the periodic table) to microkinetic modeling (with little restrictions on molecularity), full modularity so that SCINE modules can also be applied as stand-alone programs or be exchanged for external software packages that fulfill a similar purpose (to increase options for computational campaigns and to provide alternatives in case of tasks that are hard or impossible to accomplish with certain programs), (ii) high stability and autonomous operations so that control and steering by an operator is as easy as possible, and (iii) easy embedding into complex heterogeneous environments for molecular structures taken individually or in the context of a reaction network. A graphical user interface unites all modules and ensures interoperability.

Implementing these complex deep neural networks on conventional hardware is highly inefficient. In this work, we propose hardware implementation of UNet for segmentation tasks, using spintronic devices. Our approach involves designing hardware for convolution, deconvolution, ReLU, and max pooling layers of the UNet architecture. We demonstrate the synaptic behavior of the domain wall MTJ, and design convolution and deconvolution layers using the domain wall-based crossbar array. We utilize the orthogonal current injected MTJ with its continuous resistance change and showcase the ReLU and max pooling functions. We employ a hybrid simulation setup by coupling micromagnetic simulation, non-equilibrium Green's function, Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski equations, and circuit simulation with Python programming to incorporate the diverse physics of spin-transport, magnetization dynamics, and CMOS elements in our proposed designs. We evaluate our UNet design on the CamVid dataset and achieve segmentation accuracies that are comparable to software implementation.

Sensing pH at a high spatial and temporal resolution might provide crucial information in understanding the role of pH and its fluctuations in a wide range of physio-pathological cellular processes, including cancer. Here, a method to embed silica-based fluorescent pH sensors into alginate-based three-dimensional (3D) microgels tumour models, coupled with a computational method for fine data analysis, is presented. By means of confocal laser scanning microscopy, live-cell time-lapse imaging of 3D alginate microgels was performed and the extracellular pH metabolic variations were monitored in both in vitro 3D mono- and 3D co-cultures of tumour and stromal pancreatic cells. The results show that the extracellular pH is cell line-specific and time-dependent. Moreover, differences in pH were also detected between 3D monocultures versus 3D co-cultures, thus suggesting the existence of a metabolic crosstalk between tumour and stromal cells. In conclusion, the system has the potential to image multiple live cells types in a 3D environment and to decipher in real-time their pH metabolic interplay under controlled experimental conditions, thus being also a suitable platform for drug screening and personalized medicine.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 10:20:32 UTC (1,735 KB)"

Amarsi","Atomic Physics (physics.atom-ph)","The lack of reliable atomic data can be a severe limitation in astrophysical modelling, in particular of events such as kilonovae that require information on all neutron-capture elements across a wide range of ionization stages. Notably, the presence of non-orthonormalities between electron orbitals representing configurations that are close in energy can introduce significant inaccuracies in computed energies and transition probabilities. Here, we propose an explicit targeted optimization method that can effectively circumvent this concern while retaining an orthonormal orbital basis set. We illustrate this method within the framework of small-scale atomic structure models of Au I, using the GRASP2018 multiconfigurational Dirac-Hartree-Fock atomic structure code. By comparing to conventional optimization schemes we show how a targeted optimization approach improves the energy level positioning and ordering. Targeted optimization also leads to better agreement with experimental data for the strongest E1 transitions. This illustrates how small-scale models can be significantly improved with minor computational costs if orbital non-orthonormalities are considered carefully. These results should prove useful to multi-element atomic structure calculations in, for example, astrophysical opacity applications involving neutron-capture elements.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 10:01:18 UTC (97 KB)"

The scalability and the potential to compute beyond the von Neumann model make VO2 especially appealing for implementation in oscillating neural networks for artificial intelligence (AI) applications, to solve constraint satisfaction problems, and for pattern recognition. Its integration into large networks of oscillators on a Silicon platform still poses challenges associated with the stabilization in the correct oxidation state and the ability to fabricate a structure with predictable electrical behavior showing very low variability. In this work, the role played by the different annealing parameters applied by three methods (slow thermal annealing, flash annealing, and rapid thermal annealing), following the vanadium oxide atomic layer deposition (ALD), on the formation of VO2 grains is studied and an optimal substrate stack configuration that minimizes variability between devices is proposed. Material and electrical characterizations are performed on the different films and a step-by-step recipe to build reproducible VO2-based oscillators is presented, which is argued to be made possible thanks to the introduction of a hafnium oxide (HfO2) layer between the silicon substrate and the vanadium oxide layer.

To address this, we propose a two-step deep-learning workflow with high efficiency and noise immunity for DAS-based traffic monitoring, focusing on instance vehicle trajectory segmentation and velocity estimation. Our approach begins by generating a diverse synthetic DAS dataset with labeled vehicle signals, tackling the issue of missing training labels in this field. This dataset is used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect linear vehicle trajectories from the noisy DAS data in the time-space domain. However, due to significant noise, these trajectories are often fragmented and incomplete. To enhance accuracy, we introduce a second step involving the Hough transform. This converts detected linear features into point-like energy clusters in the Hough domain. Another CNN is then employed to focus on these energies, identifying the most significant points. The inverse Hough transform is applied to these points to reconstruct complete, distinct, and noise-free linear vehicle trajectories in the time-space domain. The Hough transform plays a crucial role by enforcing a local linearity constraint on the trajectories, enhancing continuity and noise immunity, and facilitating the separation of individual trajectories and estimation of vehicle velocities (indicated by trajectory slopes in the Hough domain). Our method has shown effectiveness in real-world datasets, proving its value in real-time processing of DAS data and applicability in similar traffic monitoring scenarios.

This can make it more difficult to extract, recognize, and analyze features in the images, as well as impair the accuracy of computer-assisted diagnostic techniques and the ability of doctors to interpret the images. Reducing speckle noise, therefore, is a crucial step in the preprocessing of ultrasound images. Researchers have proposed several speckle reduction methods, but no single method takes all relevant factors into account. In this paper, we compare seven such methods: Median, Gaussian, Bilateral, Average, Weiner, Anisotropic and Denoising auto-encoder without and with skip connections in terms of their ability to preserve features and edges while effectively reducing noise. In an experimental study, a convolutional noise-removing auto-encoder with skip connection, a deep learning method, was used to improve ultrasound images of breast cancer. This method involved adding speckle noise at various levels. The results of the deep learning method were compared to those of traditional image enhancement methods, and it was found that the proposed method was more effective. To assess the performance of these algorithms, we use three established evaluation metrics and present both filtered images and statistical data.","Tue, 5 Mar 2024 08:08:59 UTC (4,143 KB)"

These events, which are, in most cases, products of magnetic reconnection-driven processes during solar flares or fast coronal-mass-ejection-driven shock waves, pose significant radiation hazards to aviation, space-based electronics, and particularly, space exploration. In this work, we utilize the recently developed dataset that combines the Solar Dynamics Observatory/Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager's (SDO/HMI) Space weather HMI Active Region Patches (SHARP) and the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory/Michelson Doppler Imager's (SoHO/MDI) Space Weather MDI Active Region Patches (SMARP).

We study some interactions between the theory of universal sets, unitary t-designs, and photonics: while many of the results we state in this direction may be known to experts, we aim to bring them to the attention of the broader quantum information science community and to phrase them in ways that are more familiar to this community. We prove, translating a result from representation theory, that there are no non-universal infinite closed $2$-designs in $U(V)$ when $\dim V \geq 2$. As a consequence, we observe that linear optical unitaries form a $1$-design but not a 2-design. Finally, we apply a result of Oszmaniec and Zimborás to prove that augmenting the linear optical unitaries with any nontrivial SNAP gate is sufficient to achieve universality.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 22:06:21 UTC (904 KB)"

Wong, Christophe Moser, Demetri Psaltis","Optics (physics.optics)","Electronic computers have evolved drastically over the past years with an ever-growing demand for improved performance. However, the transfer of information from memory and high energy consumption have emerged as issues that require solutions. Optical techniques are considered promising solutions to these problems with higher speed than their electronic counterparts and with reduced energy consumption. Here, we use the optical reservoir computing framework we have previously described (Scalable Optical Learning Operator or SOLO) to program the spatial-spectral output of the light after nonlinear propagation in a multimode fiber. The novelty in the current paper is that the system is programmed through an output sampling scheme, similar to that used in hyperspectral imaging in astronomy. Linear and nonlinear computations are performed by light in the multimode fiber and the high dimensional spatial-spectral information at the fiber output is optically programmed before it reaches the camera. We then used a digital computer to classify the programmed output of the multi-mode fiber using a simple, single layer network. When combining front-end programming and the proposed spatial-spectral programming, we were able to achieve 89.9% classification accuracy on the dataset consisting of chest X-ray images from COVID-19 patients. At the same time, we obtained a decrease of 99% in the number of tunable parameters compared to an equivalently performing digital neural network. These results show that the performance of programmed SOLO is comparable with cutting-edge electronic computing platforms, albeit with a much-reduced number of electronic operations.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 20:09:56 UTC (780 KB)"
"27","Quantum Frequential Computing: a quadratic run time advantage for all algorithms","Mischa P. Woods","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","We introduce a new class of computer called a quantum frequential computer. They harness quantum properties in a different way to conventional quantum computers to generate a quadratic computational run time advantage for all algorithms as a function of the power consumed. They come in two variants: type 1 can process classical algorithms only while type 2 can also process quantum ones. In a type-1 quantum frequential computer, only the control is quantum, while in a type 2 the logical space is also quantum. We also prove that a quantum frequential computer only requires a classical data bus to function. This is useful, because it means that only a relatively small part of the overall architecture of the computer needs to be quantum in a type-1 quantum frequential computer in order to achieve a quadratic run time advantage. As with classical and conventional quantum computers, quantum frequential computers also generate heat and require cooling. We also characterise these requirements.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 19:00:02 UTC (3,714 KB)"

Focusing on the least-cost routing problem, the discussion is organized with respect to the use of Metzler functions and Metzler matrices to model the dynamics of information propagation among news providers. With this approach, we designed a strategy to minimize the spread of fake news, which is detrimental to informational health, while at the same time maximizing the spread of credible information. In particular, through the punitive dominance problem and the maximum compensation problem, we developed and examined a path to reassess the incentives of news providers to act and to analyze their impact on the equilibrium of the information market. By applying the concept of entanglement to the context of information propagation, we shed light on the complexity of interactions among news providers and contribute to the formulation of more effective information management strategies.

Some motional modes of multi-ion crystals take orders-of-magnitude longer to cool than others because of low coolant ion participation. Here we demonstrate a new technique, which we call phonon rapid adiabatic passage (phrap), that avoids this issue by coherently exchanging the thermal populations of selected modes on timescales short compared to direct cooling. Analogous to adiabatic rapid passage, we quasi-statically couple these slow-cooling modes with fast-cooling ones using DC electric fields. When the crystal is then adiabatically ramped through the resultant avoided crossing, nearly-complete phonon population exchange results. We demonstrate this on two-ion crystals, and show the indirect ground-state cooling of all radial modes--achieving an order of magnitude speedup compared to direct cooling. We also show the technique's insensitivity to trap potential and control field fluctuations, and find that it still achieves sub-quanta temperatures starting as high as n~200.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:52:14 UTC (864 KB)"

In contrast to the most of HOC schemes developed on polar coordinates, as available in the literature, there is no necessity to transform domain for the present scheme. We begin the study by employing our scheme to two test problems having analytical solutions, followed by time marching simulation for driven polar cavity and natural convection in horizontal concentric annulus. In the process, a one-sided approximation for the Neumann boundary condition for vorticity is also developed. The scheme is found to be well capable of handling complex flow patterns as it combines the advantages of body fitted mesh as well as nonuniformity of grids. The scheme reported a second-order temporal convergence and in space it approached to fourth order convergence for problems with analytical solutions. For the cases where no analytical solutions are available, we have determined the perceived rate of convergence in space for all the variables. The computed values of various flow parameters are being compared to the values available in the literature. Results are extremely close to the available numerical and experimental results in all the cases, both qualitative and quantitatively.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 18:26:13 UTC (8,551 KB)"

In the single layer case, it has been shown that the regular variation of the weight distribution underlying the inhomogeneous random graph implies the regular variation of the typical degree distribution. We extend this correspondence to the multilayer case by showing that the multivariate regular variation of the weight distribution implies the multivariate regular variation of the asymptotic degree distribution. Furthermore, in certain circumstances, the extremal dependence structure present in the weight distribution will be adopted by the asymptotic degree distribution. By considering the asymptotic degree distribution, a wider class of Chung-Lu and Norros-Reittu graphs may be incorporated into the MIRG layers. Additionally, we prove consistency of the Hill estimator when applied to degrees of the MIRG that have a tail index greater than 1. Simulation results indicate that, in practice, hidden regular variation may be consistently detected from an observed MIRG.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 17:08:25 UTC (535 KB)"

The finite-time driving of such systems and associated optimal energetic costs have not been investigated yet. We consider two universality classes Model A and Model B, that describe the dynamics for the non-conserved and conserved scalar order parameters respectively. Here, using the recent developments in stochastic thermodynamics and optimal transport theory, we analytically compute the optimal driving protocols by minimizing the mean stochastic work required for finite-time driving. Further, we numerically optimize the mean and variance of the stochastic work simultaneously. Such a multi-objective optimization is called a Pareto optimization problem and its optimal solution is a Pareto front. We discover a first-order Pareto phase transition in the Pareto front. Physically, it corresponds to the coexistence of two classes of optimal driving protocols analogous to the liquid-gas coexistence for the equilibrium phase transition. Our framework sheds light on the finite-time optimal driving of the fields and the trade-off between the mean and fluctuations of the optimal work.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 17:02:52 UTC (652 KB)"

Most current MLPs construct the energy of a system as a sum of atomic energies, which depend on information about the atomic environments provided in form of predefined or learnable feature vectors. If, in addition, non-local phenomena like long-range charge transfer are important, fourth-generation MLPs need to be used, which include a charge equilibration (Qeq) step to take the global structure of the system into account. This Qeq can significantly increase the computational cost and thus can become the computational bottleneck for large systems. In this paper we present a highly efficient formulation of Qeq that does not require the explicit computation of the Coulomb matrix elements resulting in a quasi-linearly scaling method. Moreover, our approach also allows for the efficient calculation of energy derivatives, which explicitly consider the global structure-dependence of the atomic charges as obtained from Qeq. Due to its generality, the method is not restricted to MLPs but can also be applied within a variety of other force fields.","Mon, 4 Mar 2024 16:04:12 UTC (81 KB)"

The validation of the approach is carried out by means of surrogate data obtained with the Armstrong-Frederick kinematic hardening model. The Mean Squared Error is assumed as the loss function which stipulates several restrictions: deviatoric character of internal variables, compliance with the flow rule, the differentiation of elastic and plastic steps and the associativity of the flow rule. The latter, however, has a minor impact on the accuracy, which implies the generalizability of the model for a broad spectrum of evolution laws for internal variables.

Next the real-space grid (RSG) implementations of the inv-KS and the HF-OEP are addressed. The total HF energies EHF for the wave functions on the effective potentials optimized by the inv-KS are computed for a set of small molecules. It is found that the mean absolute deviation (MAD) of EHF from the HF energy is clearly smaller than the MAD of EHF, demonstrating that the inv-KS is advantageous in constructing the detailed structure of the exchange potential vx as compared with the HF-OEP.

To establish this analogy, we define the optimization procedure as a two-level Bayesian inference problem that separates variable selection from coefficient values and enables the computation of the posterior parameter distribution in closed form. A key advantage of employing statistical mechanical concepts, such as free energy and the partition function, is in the quantification of uncertainty, especially in in the low-data limit; frequently encountered in real-world applications.

However, these do not prove that the best possible performance has been achieved. Fundamental limits to error rates can be estimated using information distance measures. To this end, the confusion matrix has been formulated to comply with the Chernoff-Stein Lemma. This links the error rates to the Kullback-Leibler divergences between the probability density functions describing the two classes. This leads to a key result that relates Cohen's Kappa to the Resistor Average Distance which is the parallel resistor combination of the two Kullback-Leibler divergences. The Resistor Average Distance has units of bits and is estimated from the same training data used by the classification algorithm, using kNN estimates of the KullBack-Leibler divergences. The classification algorithm gives the confusion matrix and Kappa. Theory and methods are discussed in detail and then applied to Monte Carlo data and real datasets. Four very different real datasets - Breast Cancer, Coronary Heart Disease, Bankruptcy, and Particle Identification - are analysed, with both continuous and discrete values, and their classification performance compared to the expected theoretical limit. In all cases this analysis shows that the algorithms could not have performed any better due to the underlying probability density functions for the two classes. Important lessons are learnt on how to predict the performance of algorithms for imbalanced data using training datasets that are approximately balanced.

The formulation relies on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations coupled with the negative Spalart-Allmaras (SA) model and three novel convective stabilisations, inspired by Riemann solvers, are derived and compared numerically. The resulting method achieves first-order convergence of the velocity, the velocity-gradient tensor and the pressure. FCFV accurately predicts engineering quantities of interest, such as drag and lift, on unstructured meshes and, by avoiding gradient reconstruction, the method is insensitive to mesh quality, even in the presence of highly distorted and stretched cells. A monolithic and a staggered solution strategies for the RANS-SA system are derived and compared numerically. Numerical benchmarks, involving laminar and turbulent, steady and transient cases are used to assess the performance, accuracy and robustness of the proposed FCFV method.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 12:12:47 UTC (17,916 KB)"

The main goal is to be able to maintain in the synthetic dataset the correlations of the features present in the original one, while offering a comfortable privacy level that can be eventually tailored on specific customer demands. We describe in detail our algorithm used both for the analysis of the original dataset and for the generation of the synthetic data points. The approach is tested using a large energy-related dataset. We obtain good results both qualitatively (e.g. via vizualizing correlation maps) and quantitatively (in terms of suitable $\ell^1$-type error norms used as evaluation metrics). The proposed methodology is general in the sense that it does not rely on the used test dataset. We expect it to be applicable in a much broader context than indicated here.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 10:35:46 UTC (493 KB)"
"53","\textit{Ab initio} calculations of photocurrent in solids based on Wannier function","Junqing Xu, Haixiao Xiao","Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)","We present a general \textit{ab initio} method based on Wannier function for simulating the photocurrent in solids. The method is widely applicable to charge/spin DC and AC photocurrent at any perturbation levels in both semiconductors and metals for both linearly and circularly polarized light. This is because the method is theoretically complete (within relaxation time approximation), that is to say, it includes all intra-band, inter-band and their cross terms. Specifically for the second-order DC photocurrent, it includes all of the following contributions - shift current, (magnetic) injection current, Berry curvature dipole, gyration current and Fermi surface ones, instead of only a part of them as in most previous \textit{ab initio} methods. It is also free from the degeneracy issue, i.e., applicable to arbitrary band structures with arbitrary numbers of degenerate bands. We apply the method to various semiconductors and metals, including GaAs, graphene-hBN heterostructure, monolayer WS$_{2}$, a 2D ferroelectric material - monolayer GeS, bilayer anti-ferromagnetic MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ and topological Weyl semimetal RhSi to simulate their charge and/or spin, DC and/or AC photocurrent. Our theoretical results are in good agreement with previous theoretical works. Our method provides a universal computational tool for reliable and accurate predictions of abundant weak-field photocurrent phenomena in disparate materials.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 06:07:15 UTC (2,045 KB)"

Previous works demonstrate that dual frequency comb spectroscopy can provide low uncertainty diagnostics of multiple flow parameters in the non-combusting regions of ramjets. However, the high temperatures present in the combustor present a challenge for broadband spectroscopic absorption models that are used to interpret measurements in these regions. Here, we utilize a new water vapor absorption database created for high temperature water-air mixtures to fit spectra measured in a ground-test ramjet engine with a broadband near-infrared dual comb absorption spectrometer. We extract 2D profiles of pressure, temperature, water mole fraction, and velocity using this new database. We demonstrate that the new database provides the lowest fit residuals compared to other water vapor absorption databases. We compare computational fluid dynamics simulations of the combustor with the measured data to demonstrate that the simulations overpredict heat release and water vapor production.","Sun, 3 Mar 2024 02:55:52 UTC (918 KB)"

Robert Frost","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","We describe a set of network analysis methods based on the rows of the Krylov subspace matrix computed from a network adjacency matrix via power iteration using a non-random initial vector. We refer to these node-specific row vectors as Krylov subspace trajectories. While power iteration using a random initial starting vector is commonly applied to the network adjacency matrix to compute eigenvector centrality values, this application only uses the final vector generated after numerical convergence. Importantly, use of a random initial vector means that the intermediate results of power iteration are also random and lack a clear interpretation. To the best of our knowledge, use of intermediate power iteration results for network analysis has been limited to techniques that leverage just a single pre-convergence solution, e.g., Power Iteration Clustering. In this paper, we explore methods that apply power iteration with a non-random inital vector to the network adjacency matrix to generate Krylov subspace trajectories for each node. These non-random trajectories provide important information regarding network structure, node importance, and response to perturbations. We have created this short preprint in part to generate feedback from others in the network analysis community who might be aware of similar existing work.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 17:13:00 UTC (408 KB)"

There is the classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput. Phys., 83 (1989) 32-78). However, in recent years there is also an alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method which has recently been formalized into a very useful general-purpose algorithm for conservation laws (Balsara et al., Efficient Alternative Finite Difference WENO Schemes for Hyperbolic Conservation Laws, submitted to CAMC (2023)). However, the FD-WENO algorithm has only very recently been formulated for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products (Balsara et al., Efficient Finite Difference WENO Scheme for Hyperbolic Systems with Non-Conservative Products, to appear CAMC (2023)). In this paper we show that there are substantial advantages in obtaining an AFD-WENO algorithm for hyperbolic systems with non-conservative products. Such an algorithm is documented in this paper. We present an AFD-WENO formulation in fluctuation form that is carefully engineered to retrieve the flux form when that is warranted and nevertheless extends to non-conservative products. The method is flexible because it allows any Riemann solver to be used. The formulation we arrive at is such that when non-conservative products are absent it reverts exactly to the formulation in the second citation above which is in exact flux conservation form. The ability to transition to a precise conservation form when non-conservative products are absent ensures, via the Lax-Wendroff theorem, that shock locations will be exactly ...","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 17:03:29 UTC (4,608 KB)"

Such schemes come in two formulations. The very popular classical finite difference WENO (FD-WENO) method (Shu and Osher, J. Comput.

However, the method cannot accommodate different types of Riemann solvers and cannot preserve free stream boundary conditions on curvilinear meshes. This limits its utility. The alternative finite difference WENO (AFD-WENO) method can overcome these deficiencies, however, much less work has been done on this method. The reasons are three-fold. First, it is difficult for the casual reader to understand the intricate logic that requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be evaluated at zone boundaries. The analytical methods for deriving the update equation for AFD-WENO schemes are somewhat recondite. To overcome that difficulty, we provide an easily accessible script that is based on a computer algebra system in Appendix A of this paper. Second, the method relies on interpolation rather than reconstruction, and WENO interpolation formulae have not been documented in the literature as thoroughly as WENO reconstruction formulae. In this paper, we explicitly provide all necessary WENO interpolation formulae that are needed for implementing AFD-WENO up to ninth order. The third reason is that AFD-WENO requires higher order derivatives of the fluxes to be available at zone boundaries. Since those derivatives are usually obtained by finite differencing the zone-centered fluxes, they become susceptible to a Gibbs phenomenon when the solution ...","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 16:55:17 UTC (5,258 KB)"
"58","Ultra-high numerical aperture waveguide-integrated meta beam shaper","Hrishikesh Iyer, Yurii Vlasov","Optics (physics.optics)","Integration of metasurfaces with guided mode sources like waveguides have opened new frontiers for on-chip optical integration. However, the state-of-the-art in the field has targeted applications where long focal distances over thousands of light wavelengths are needed. This regime where the paraxial approximation holds enables inverse design of the metasurfaces with weakly confining elements that are typically thicker than the wavelength in the material. For short-focal length applications at distances less than 100{\lambda} where the paraxial approximation fails, and high numerical apertures (NA) are necessary, a different approach is required. Here we designed and experimentally demonstrated single-mode waveguide-integrated meta beam shapers capable of redirecting the confined light into the free space and focusing it at focal distances less than 100{\lambda} above the chip surface into a tightly focused spot. Focal spot characteristics measured at 460nm operating wavelength are approaching diffraction limited focusing across a range of focal lengths, device footprints, and numerical apertures demonstrating the robustness of our approach. Focal volumes smaller than 1{\mu}m^3 are demonstrated for a range of focal distances below 50{\mu}m. For a device with some of the highest NA amongst integrated metasurfaces of 0.95 the measured focal volume is as small as just 0.06{\mu}m^3 at a focal distance of 13{\mu}m. These on-chip integrated ultra-high NA meta beam shapers have the potential to unlock new applications in quantum optical computing with trapped ions, localized optogenetic neurostimulation, and high resolution in-situ microscopy.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 15:45:13 UTC (9,241 KB)"

This paper explores an approach for active learning in molecular discovery using Deep Kernel Learning (DKL), a novel approach surpassing the limits of classical Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Employing the QM9 dataset, we contrast DKL with traditional VAEs, which analyze molecular structures based on similarity, revealing limitations due to sparse regularities in latent spaces. DKL, however, offers a more holistic perspective by correlating structure with properties, creating latent spaces that prioritize molecular functionality. This is achieved by recalculating embedding vectors iteratively, aligning with the experimental availability of target properties. The resulting latent spaces are not only better organized but also exhibit unique characteristics such as concentrated maxima representing molecular functionalities and a correlation between predictive uncertainty and error. Additionally, the formation of exclusion regions around certain compounds indicates unexplored areas with potential for groundbreaking functionalities. This study underscores DKL's potential in molecular research, offering new avenues for understanding and discovering molecular functionalities beyond classical VAE limitations.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 15:34:31 UTC (3,918 KB)"

Zhang","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","Purpose: Despite recent advances, chemical shift-encoded MRI (CSE-MRI) remains a challenging problem and many algorithms are computationally expensive, leading to interest in deep learning-based methods. However, initial attempts have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are limited by data requirements, poor generalisability across different anatomies (anatomy-dependence) and training time. To address these limitations, we propose RAIDER, a method for rapid, anatomy-independent deep learning-based CSE-MRI. Theory and Methods: RAIDER uses two multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), each trained separately with simulated single-voxel data, thus avoiding the degeneracy encountered during training when using only one network. During inference, the solution from one of the two networks is chosen based on likelihood. Performance and speed are investigated in a series of simulation experiments, in phantoms and in vivo. Results: RAIDER is approximately 700 times faster than conventional fitting, taking 14us per voxel rather than 10ms, and offers performance similar to that of conventional fitting. It produces accurate fat fraction measurements in phantoms and in vivo images with different anatomies, despite having been trained only on simulation data. Conclusion: RAIDER resolves the problems posed by degeneracy, avoids the training data requirements of CNN-based methods and markedly reduces computational cost compared to conventional fitting.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 11:12:13 UTC (2,358 KB)"

Kim, Nicolas Perrin-Gilbert, Erkan Narmanli, Paul Klein, Christopher R. Myers, Itai Cohen, Joshua J. Waterfall, James P. Sethna","Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Natural systems with emergent behaviors often organize along low-dimensional subsets of high-dimensional spaces. For example, despite the tens of thousands of genes in the human genome, the principled study of genomics is fruitful because biological processes rely on coordinated organization that results in lower dimensional phenotypes. To uncover this organization, many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have successfully embedded high-dimensional data into low-dimensional spaces by preserving local similarities between data points. However, the nonlinearities in these methods allow for too much curvature to preserve general trends across multiple non-neighboring data clusters, thereby limiting their interpretability and generalizability to out-of-distribution data. Here, we address both of these limitations by regularizing the curvature of manifolds generated by variational autoencoders, a process we coin ``$\Gamma$-VAE''. We demonstrate its utility using two example data sets: bulk RNA-seq from the The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx); and single cell RNA-seq from a lineage tracing experiment in hematopoietic stem cell differentiation. We find that the resulting regularized manifolds identify mesoscale structure associated with different cancer cell types, and accurately re-embed tissues from completely unseen, out-of distribution cancers as if they were originally trained on them. Finally, we show that preserving long-range relationships to differentiated cells separates undifferentiated cells -- which have not yet specialized -- according to their eventual fate. Broadly, we anticipate that regularizing the curvature of generative models will enable more consistent, predictive, and generalizable models in any high-dimensional system with emergent low-dimensional behavior.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 03:26:09 UTC (15,801 KB)"

In this work, deep neural network method and data generated by $ab-initio$ molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations were deployed to build a high-fidelity MLFF. Radial distribution functions, Li-ion mean square displacements (MSD), diffusion coefficients, ionic conductivity, activation energy, and crystallographic direction-dependent migration barriers were calculated and compared with corresponding AIMD and experimental data to benchmark the accuracy of the MLFF. From MSD analysis, we captured both the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics. The latter reveals that the Li-ions are involved in anti-correlation motion that was rarely reported for solid-state materials. Similarly, the self and distinct parts of Li-ion dynamics were used to determine Haven's ratio to describe the Li-ion transport mechanism in Li$_3$TiCl$_6$. Obtained trajectory from molecular dynamics infers that the Li-ion transportation is mainly through interstitial hopping which was confirmed by intra- and inter-layer Li-ion displacement with respect to simulation time. Ionic conductivity (1.06 mS/cm) and activation energy (0.29eV) calculated by our simulation are highly comparable with that of experimental values. Overall, the combination of machine-learning methods and AIMD simulations explains the intricate electrochemical properties of the Li$_3$TiCl$_6$ cathode with remarkably reduced computational time. Thus, our work strongly suggests that the deep neural network-based MLFF could be a promising method for large-scale complex materials.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 03:14:46 UTC (2,572 KB)"
"63","An ""Opinion Reproduction Number"" for Infodemics in a Bounded-Confidence Content-Spreading Process on Networks","Heather Z. Brooks, Mason A. Porter","Physics and Society (physics.soc-ph)","We study the spreading dynamics of content on networks. To do this, we use a model in which content spreads through a bounded-confidence mechanism. In a bounded-confidence model (BCM) of opinion dynamics, the agents of a network have continuous-valued opinions, which they adjust when they interact with agents whose opinions are sufficiently close to theirs. The employed content-spread model introduces a twist into BCMs by using bounded confidence for the content spread itself. To study the spread of content, we define an analogue of the basic reproduction number from disease dynamics that we call an \emph{opinion reproduction number}. A critical value of the opinion reproduction number indicates whether or not there is an ``infodemic'' (i.e., a large content-spreading cascade) of content that reflects a particular opinion. By determining this critical value, one can determine whether or not an opinion will die off or propagate widely as a cascade in a population of agents. Using configuration-model networks, we quantify the size and shape of content dissemination using a variety of summary statistics, and we illustrate how network structure and spreading model parameters affect these statistics. We find that content spreads most widely when the agents have large expected mean degree or large receptiveness to content. When the amount of content spread only slightly exceeds the critical opinion reproduction number (i.e., the infodemic threshold), there can be longer dissemination trees than when the expected mean degree or receptiveness is larger, even though the total number of content shares is smaller.","Sat, 2 Mar 2024 02:14:41 UTC (2,746 KB)"

The characterization of these clusters is therefore a very important issue. One of the main experimental tools for characterizing their electronic structure is photoelectron spectroscopy. Theoretical computation completes the task by fully determining the structural properties and matching the theoretical predictions to the measured spectra. We present density functional theory computations of the structural, magnetic and electronic properties of negatively charged mixed Al$_{n}$Ni$^{-}$ clusters with up to 13 Al atoms. The lowest energy structures of the anionic clusters with up to 7 atoms are also found to be low energy isomers of the neutral counterparts found in the literature. The 13-atom cluster is found to be a quartet and a perfect icosahedron. The predicted photoelectron spectra are also presented and can be used to interpret future experimental data. We also presented indicators that can be used to determine the potential of these systems for single atom catalysis. These indicators point to smaller clusters to be more reactive as the gap between the Fermi energy and the center of the d-band increases with cluster size and that Ni occupy and internal site for n=11-13. We speculate that reactivity can be enhanced if one adds an additional Ni atom. Methods The DFT calculations were performed using the Becke exchange and Perdew-Wang/91 correlation functionals (BPW91), a DFT-optimized all-electron basis set for the aluminum atom and the Stuttgart small core pseudopotential for the Ni atom.

However, serious accuracy problems may emerge when taking time steps that far exceed the explicit stability limits. In our previous work, we compared the accuracy and performance of advancing parabolic operators in a thermodynamic MHD model using an implicit method and an explicit super time-stepping (STS) method. We found that while the STS method outperformed the implicit one with overall good results, it was not able to damp oscillatory behavior in the solution efficiently, hindering its practical use. In this follow-up work, we evaluate an easy-to-implement method for selecting a practical time step limit (PTL) for unconditionally stable schemes. This time step is used to `cycle' the operator-split thermal conduction and viscosity parabolic operators. We test the new time step with both an implicit and STS scheme for accuracy, performance, and scaling. We find that, for our test cases here, the PTL dramatically improves the STS solution, matching or improving the solution of the original implicit scheme, while retaining most of its performance and scaling advantages. The PTL shows promise to allow more accurate use of unconditionally stable schemes for parabolic operators and reliable use of STS methods.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 22:00:55 UTC (2,624 KB)"

Allahverdyan","Methodology (stat.ME)","Simpson's paradox is an obstacle to establishing a probabilistic association between two events $a_1$ and $a_2$, given the third (lurking) random variable $B$. We focus on scenarios when the random variables $A$ (which combines $a_1$, $a_2$, and their complements) and $B$ have a common cause $C$ that need not be observed. Alternatively, we can assume that $C$ screens out $A$ from $B$. For such cases, the correct association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ is to be defined via conditioning over $C$. This set-up generalizes the original Simpson's paradox. Now its two contradicting options simply refer to two particular and different causes $C$. We show that if $B$ and $C$ are binary and $A$ is quaternary (the minimal and the most widespread situation for valid Simpson's paradox), the conditioning over any binary common cause $C$ establishes the same direction of the association between $a_1$ and $a_2$ as the conditioning over $B$ in the original formulation of the paradox. Thus, for the minimal common cause, one should choose the option of Simpson's paradox that assumes conditioning over $B$ and not its marginalization. For tertiary (unobserved) common causes $C$ all three options of Simpson's paradox become possible (i.e. marginalized, conditional, and none of them), and one needs prior information on $C$ to choose the right option.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 20:15:28 UTC (313 KB)"

However, this development creates a gap in current computer science curricula since most quantum computing lectures are strongly physics-oriented and have little intersection with the remaining curriculum of computer science. This fact makes designing an appealing course very difficult, in particular for non-physicists. Furthermore, in the academic community, there is consensus that quantum computers are going to be used only for specific computational tasks (e.g., in computational science), where hybrid systems - combined classical and quantum computers - facilitate the execution of an application on both quantum and classical computing resources. A hybrid system thus executes only certain suitable parts of an application on the quantum machine, while other parts are executed on the classical components of the system. To fully exploit the capabilities of hybrid systems and to meet future requirements in this emerging field, we need to prepare a new generation of computer scientists with skills in both distributed computing and quantum computing. To bridge this existing gap in standard computer science curricula, we designed a new lecture and exercise series on Hybrid Quantum-Classical Systems, where students learn how to decompose applications and implement computational tasks on a hybrid quantum-classical computational continuum. While learning the inherent concepts underlying quantum systems, students are obligated to apply techniques and methods they are already familiar with, making the entrance to the field of quantum computing comprehensive yet appealing and accessible to students of computer science.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:14:50 UTC (220 KB)"

Kalinkin","Instrumentation and Detectors (physics.ins-det)","The successful realization of the EIC scientific program requires the design and construction of high-performance particle detectors. Recent developments in the field of scientific computing and increased availability of high performance computing resources have made it possible to perform optimization of multi-parameter designs, even when the latter require longer computational times (for example simulations of particle interactions with matter). Procedures involving machine-assisted techniques used to inform the design decision have seen a considerable growth in popularity among the EIC detector community. Having already been realized for tracking and RICH PID detectors, it has a potential application in calorimetry designs. A SciGlass barrel calorimeter originally designed for EIC Detector-1 has a semi-projective geometry that allows for non-trivial performance gains, but also poses special challenges in the way of effective exploration of the design space while satisfying the available space and the cell dimension constraints together with the full detector acceptance requirement. This talk will cover specific approaches taken to perform this detector design optimization.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 16:18:02 UTC (830 KB)"
"75","Equilibrium Model with Anisotropy for Model-Based Reconstruction in Magnetic Particle Imaging","Marco Maass, Tobias Kluth, Christine Droigk, Hannes Albers, Konrad Scheffler, Alfred Mertins, Tobias Knopp","Image and Video Processing (eess.IV)","Magnetic particle imaging is a tracer-based tomographic imaging technique that allows the concentration of magnetic nanoparticles to be determined with high spatio-temporal resolution. To reconstruct an image of the tracer concentration, the magnetization dynamics of the particles must be accurately modeled. A popular ensemble model is based on solving the Fokker-Plank equation, taking into account either Brownian or Néel dynamics. The disadvantage of this model is that it is computationally expensive due to an underlying stiff differential equation. A simplified model is the equilibrium model, which can be evaluated directly but in most relevant cases it suffers from a non-negligible modeling error. In the present work, we investigate an extended version of the equilibrium model that can account for particle anisotropy. We show that this model can be expressed as a series of Bessel functions, which can be truncated based on a predefined accuracy, leading to very short computation times, which are about three orders of magnitude lower than equivalent Fokker-Planck computation times. We investigate the accuracy of the model for 2D Lissajous MPI sequences and show that the difference between the Fokker-Planck and the equilibrium model with anisotropy is sufficiently small so that the latter model can be used for image reconstruction on experimental data with only marginal loss of image quality, even compared to a system matrix-based reconstruction.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 15:28:54 UTC (1,833 KB)"

This is done following two methods: by solving the exact characteristic equation and, on the other hand, by solving the nonlinear equations that result for a variable refractive index in the asymptotic approximations. Similar results with both methods are obtained with differences below $1\%$ . Nevertheless, important differences are found with respect to the resonant wavelengths computed with a constant index and with a variable index. We compute the free spectral range and the quality factor, and make a comparison between the variable index and the constant index cases. The differences are of significant relevance for the free spectral range, while for the quality factor, the constant case is insensitive to the chromatic dispersion. Our work could be useful as a pathway for designing microspheres for different applications.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 15:11:17 UTC (62 KB)"

Vaníček","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","In single vibronic level (SVL) fluorescence experiments, the electronically excited initial state is also excited in one or several vibrational modes. Whereas the time-independent approach of computing all contributing Franck-Condon factors becomes impractical in large systems, a time-dependent formalism has not been applied to simulate emission from arbitrary initial vibrational levels. Here, we apply Hagedorn functions, which are products of a Gaussian and carefully generated polynomials, to represent SVL initial states. Under an at most quadratic potential, the Hagedorn functions are exact solutions to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and can be propagated using the same equations of motion as a simple Gaussian wavepacket. Having developed an efficient recursive algorithm to compute the overlaps between two Hagedorn wavepackets, we can now evaluate emission spectra from arbitrary vibronic levels using a single trajectory. Here, we use two-dimensional global harmonic models to validate the method by comparing it with quantum split-operator calculations and to demonstrate the effects of displacement, distortion (squeezing), and Duschinsky rotation on SVL spectra. Additionally, we show the practicality of the Hagedorn approach in a high-dimensional system on a displaced, distorted, and Duschinsky-rotated harmonic model with 100 degrees of freedom.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 14:58:07 UTC (998 KB)"

In this paper, an implicit high-order gas-kinetic scheme (HGKS) is developed to remove the restrictions on the time step for unsteady simulations. In order to improve the efficiency and keep the high-order accuracy, a two-stage third-order implicit time-accurate discretization is proposed. In each stage, an artificial steady solution is obtained for the implicit system with the pseudo-time iteration. In the iteration, the classical implicit methods are adopted to solve the nonlinear system, including the lower-upper symmetric Gauss-Seidel (LUSGS) and generalized minimum residual (GMRES) methods. To achieve the spatial accuracy, the HGKSs with both non-compact and compact reconstructions are constructed. For the non-compact scheme, the weighted essentially non-oscillatory (WENO) reconstruction is used. For the compact one, the Hermite WENO (HWENO) reconstruction is adopted due to the updates of both cell-averaged flow variables and their derivatives. The expected third-order temporal accuracy is achieved with the two-stage temporal discretization. For the smooth flow, only a single artificial iteration is needed. For uniform meshes, the efficiency of the current implicit method improves significantly in comparison with the explicit one. For the flow with discontinuities, compared with the well-known Crank-Nicholson method, the spurious oscillations in the current schemes are well suppressed. The increase of the artificial iteration steps introduces extra reconstructions associating with a reduction of the computational efficiency. Overall, the current implicit method leads to an improvement in efficiency over the explicit one in the cases with a large variation of mesh size.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 12:08:31 UTC (2,686 KB)"

We use microfacets, which are small, tilted mirrors superimposed on a smooth surface. We form a simple model of surface roughness and light scattering based on the orientations of the microfacets. Using a least-squares solver to compute the smooth reflector as a starting point, we can subsequently alter the surface using an optimization procedure to account for the scattering. After optimization, the resulting reflector surface produces the desired scattered light distribution. We verify the resulting reflector using raytracing.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 11:44:24 UTC (3,112 KB)"

To reconstruct meaningful and quantitative images from the measurement intensities, however, it relies on computational phase retrieval which in many cases assumes the phase-shift and attenuation coefficient of the sample to be proportional. Here, we demonstrate an efficient phase retrieval algorithm that does not rely on this homogeneous-object assumption and is a generalization of the well-established contrast-transfer-function (CTF) approach. We then investigate its stability and present an experimental study comparing the proposed algorithm with established methods. The algorithm shows superior reconstruction quality compared to the established CTF-based method at similar computational cost. Our analysis provides a deeper fundamental understanding of the homogeneous object assumption and the proposed algorithm will help improve the image quality for near-field holography in biomedical applications","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 11:32:12 UTC (2,355 KB)"

In consequence, calibration is almost never validated and the diagnostic is left to the appreciation of the reader. Simulated reference values, based on synthetic calibrated datasets derived from actual uncertainties, have been proposed to palliate this problem. As the generative probability distribution for the simulation of synthetic errors is often not constrained, the sensitivity of simulated reference values to the choice of generative distribution might be problematic, shedding a doubt on the calibration diagnostic. This study explores various facets of this problem, and shows that some statistics are excessively sensitive to the choice of generative distribution to be used for validation when the generative distribution is unknown. This is the case, for instance, of the correlation coefficient between absolute errors and uncertainties (CC) and of the expected normalized calibration error (ENCE). A robust validation workflow to deal with simulated reference values is proposed.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 10:19:32 UTC (3,716 KB)"
"83","List-Mode PET Image Reconstruction Using Dykstra-Like Splitting","Kibo Ote, Fumio Hashimoto, Yuya Onishi, Yasuomi Ouchi","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","To converge the block iterative method in image reconstruction for positron emission tomography (PET), careful control of relaxation parameters is required, which is a challenging task. The automatic determination of relaxation parameters for list-mode reconstructions also remains challenging. Therefore, a different approach than controlling relaxation parameters would be desired by list-mode PET reconstruction. In this study, we propose a list-mode maximum likelihood Dykstra-like splitting PET reconstruction (LM-MLDS). LM-MLDS converges the list-mode block iterative method by adding the distance from an initial image as a penalty term into an objective function. LM-MLDS takes a two-step approach because its performance depends on the quality of the initial image. The first step uses a uniform image as the initial image, and then the second step uses a reconstructed image after one main iteration as the initial image. We evaluated LM-MLDS using simulation and clinical data. LM-MLDS provided a higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and suppressed an oscillation of tradeoff curves between noise and contrast than the other block iterative methods. In a clinical study, LM-MLDS removed the false hotspots at the edge of the axial field of view and improved the image quality of slices covering the top of the head to the cerebellum. LM-MLDS showed different noise properties than the other methods due to Gaussian denoising induced by the proximity operator. The list-mode proximal splitting PET reconstruction is useful not only for optimizing nondifferentiable functions such as total variation but also for converging block iterative methods without controlling relaxation parameters.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 09:29:41 UTC (970 KB)"

As the acoustic shock distance decreases with the increase of incident frequency, the nonlinear propagation effect will play a role in acoustic streaming, e.g., Eckart (bulk) streaming at a few gigahertz (GHz). However, the theory of source terms of bulk streaming is still missing at this stage when high-order acoustic harmonics play a role. In this paper, we derive the source term including the contribution of higher-order harmonics. The streaming-induced hydrodynamic flow is assumed to be incompressible and no shock wave occurs during the nonlinear acoustic propagation as restricted by the traditional Goldberg number \Gamma < 1 or \Gamma \approx 1 which indicates the importance of nonlinearity relative to dissipation. The derived force terms allow evaluating bulk streaming with high-order harmonics at GHz and provide an exact expression compared to the existing empirical formulas. Numerical results show that the contribution of higher-order harmonics increases the streaming flow velocity by more than 20%. We show that the expression introduced by Nyborg should be avoided in numerical computations as it includes part of the acoustic radiation force that does not lead to acoustic streaming.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 08:25:18 UTC (624 KB)"

You","Quantum Physics (quant-ph)","Quantum computing, quantum communication and quantum networks rely on hybrid quantum systems operating in different frequency ranges. For instance, the superconducting qubits work in the gigahertz range, while the optical photons used in communication are in the range of hundreds of terahertz. Due to the large frequency mismatch, achieving the direct coupling and information exchange between different information carriers is generally difficult. Accordingly, a quantum interface is demanded, which serves as a bridge to establish information linkage between different quantum systems operating at distinct frequencies. Recently, the magnon mode in ferromagnetic spin systems has received significant attention. While the inherent weak optomagnonic coupling strength restricts the microwave-to-optical photon conversion efficiency using magnons, the versatility of the magnon modes, together with their readily achievable strong coupling with other quantum systems, endow them with many distinct advantages. Here, we realize the magnon-based microwave-light interface by adopting an optical cavity with adjustable free spectrum range and different kinds of magnetostatic modes in two microwave cavity configurations. By optimizing the parameters, an internal conversion efficiency of $1.28 \times 10^{-7}$ is achieved. We analyze the impact of various parameters on the microwave-to-optics conversion. The study provides useful guidance and insights to further enhancing the microwave-to-optics conversion efficiency using magnons.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 08:17:18 UTC (22,126 KB)[v2] Tue, 5 Mar 2024 03:11:02 UTC (22,126 KB)"

The latter is responsible for the appearance of two separated radiative and non-radiative channels in the extinction spectrum of these structures. This unique property can open a wealth of opportunities towards the development of multifunctional systems that simultaneously can behave as optimal scatterers and absorbers at different wavelengths, an important feature to achieve multiscale control light-matter interactions in different spectral regions for different types of applications, such as optical computing or detection of thermal radiation. Nevertheless, the temperature dependence of the optical properties of these multilayered systems has never been investigated. In this work we study how radiative and non-radiative processes in hyperbolic meta-antennas can probe temperature changes of the surrounding medium. We show that, while radiative processes are essentially not affected by a change in the external temperature, the non-radiative ones are strongly affected by a temperature variation. By combining experiments and temperature dependent effective medium theory, we find that this behavior is connected to enhanced damping effects due to electron-phonon scattering. Contrary to standard plasmonic systems, a red-shift of the non-radiative mode occurs for small variations of the environment temperature. Our study shows that to probe temperature changes it is essential to exploit non-radiative processes in systems supporting plasmonic excitations, which can be used as very sensitive thermometers via linear absorption spectroscopy.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 07:38:51 UTC (889 KB)[v2] Mon, 4 Mar 2024 07:50:32 UTC (1,113 KB)"

Our objective is to use machine learning (ML) to construct scanning sequences, parameterized by time delays and apodization weights, that produce high quality B-mode images. Approach: We use an ML model in PyTorch and simulated RF data from Field II to probe the space of possible encoding sequences for those that minimize a loss function that describes image quality. This approach is made computationally feasible by a novel formulation of the derivative for delay-and-sum beamforming. We demonstrate these results experimentally on wire targets and a tissue-mimicking phantom. Main Results: When trained according to a given set of imaging parameters (imaging domain, hardware restrictions), our ML imaging model produces optimized encoding sequences that improve a number of standard quality metrics including resolution, field of view, and contrast, over conventional sequences. Significance: This work demonstrates that the set of encoding schemes that are commonly used represent only a narrow subset of those available. Additionally, it demonstrates the value for ML tasks in synthetic transmit aperture imaging to consider the beamformer within the model, instead of as purely post-processing.","Fri, 1 Mar 2024 05:19:59 UTC (3,588 KB)"

By invoking the Cayley-Hamilton theorem on the transfer matrix for the electromagnetic field in a periodic stratified media formed by N cells, we obtain a fourth-degree recursive relation for the matrix coefficients that defines the so-called Tetranacci Polynomials. In the symmetric case, corresponding to a unit-cell transfer matrix with a characteristic polynomial where the coefficients of the linear and cubic terms are equal, closed expressions for the solutions to the recursive relation, known as symmetric Tetranacci Polynomials, have recently been derived, allowing us to write the transfer matrix and transmittance in a closed form. We show as sufficient conditions that the $4\times4$ differential propagation matrix of each layer in the binary unit cell, $\Delta$, a) has eigenvalues of the form $\pm p_1$, $\pm p_2$, with $p_1\ne p_2$, and b) its off-diagonal $2\times2$ block matrices possess the same symmetric structure in both layers. Otherwise, the recursive relations are still solvable for any $4\times4$-matrix and provide an algorithm to compute the N-th power of the transfer matrix without carrying out explicitly the matrix multiplication of N matrices. We obtain analytical expressions for the dispersion relation and transmittance, in closed form, for two finite periodic systems: the first one consists of two birefringent uniaxial media with their optical axis perpendicular to the z-axis, and the second consists of two isotropic media subject to an external magnetic field oriented along the z-axis and exhibiting the Faraday effect.

The binary collision of point-like particles, typically the dominant process for reaching thermal equilibrium in higher dimensional systems, cannot thermalize a 1D system. We study how dilute classical 1D gases thermalize through three-body collisions. We consider a system of identical classical point particles with pairwise repulsive inverse power-law potential $V_{ij} \propto 1/|x_i-x_j|^n$ or the pairwise Lennard-Jones potential. Using Monte Carlo methods, we compute a collision kernel and use it in the Boltzmann equation to evolve a perturbed thermal state with temperature $T$ toward equilibrium. We explain the shape of the kernel and its dependence on the system parameters. Additionally, we implement molecular dynamics simulations of a many-body gas and show agreement with the Boltzmann evolution in the low density limit. For the inverse power-law potential, the rate of thermalization is proportional to $\rho^2 T^{\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{n}}$ where $\rho$ is the number density.

Boone","Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)","This computational research study analyzes the increase of the specific charge capacity that comes with the reduction of the anisotropic volume expansion during lithium ion insertion within silicon nanowires. This research paper is a continuation from previous work that studied the expansion rate and volume increase. It has been determined that when the lithium ion concentration is decreased by regulating the amount of Li ion flux, the lithium ions to silicon atoms ratio, represented by x, decreases within the amorphous lithiated silicon (a-LixSi) material. This results in a decrease in the volumetric strain of the lithiated silicon nanowire as well as a reduction in Maxwell stress that was calculated and Youngs elastic module that was measured experimentally using nanoindentation. The conclusion as will be seen is that as there is a decrease in lithium ion concentration there is a corresponding decrease in anisotropic volume and a resulting increase in specific charge capacity. In fact the amplification of the electromagnetic field due to the electron flux that created detrimental effects for a fully lithiated silicon nanowire at x = 3.75 which resulted in over a 300 percent volume expansion becomes beneficial with the decrease in lithium ion flux as x approaches 0.75, which leads to a marginal volume increase of 25 percent. This could lead to the use of crystalline silicon, c-Si, as an anode material that has been demonstrated in many previous research works to be ten times greater charge capacity than carbon base anode material for lithium ion batteries.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 18:25:23 UTC (1,870 KB)"

Thus, there is still a significant divide between transforming predictions into results that are actually achievable in the lab, and an even greater lag in scaling predicted materials into functional devices. In this perspective, we outline some of the major disconnects in this materials discovery process -- from scaling computational predictions into synthesizable crystals and thin films in the laboratory, to scaling lab-grown films into real-world solar devices -- and share insights to inform future strategies for TC discovery and design.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 17:27:05 UTC (10,565 KB)"

Previous studies successfully clarified the factors contributing to trends in each streaming service, yet the similarities and differences between platforms are commonly unexplored; moreover, the influence of social connections and cultural similarity is usually overlooked. We hereby examine the social aspects of three significant streaming services--Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube--with an emphasis on the dissemination of content across countries. Using two-year-long trending chart datasets, we find that streaming content can be divided into two types: video-oriented (Netflix) and audio-oriented (Spotify). This characteristic is differentiated by accounting for the significance of social connectedness and linguistic similarity: audio-oriented content travels via social links, but video-oriented content tends to spread throughout linguistically akin countries. Interestingly, user-generated contents, YouTube, exhibits a dual characteristic by integrating both visual and auditory characteristics, indicating the platform is evolving into unique medium rather than simply residing a midpoint between video and audio media.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:31:54 UTC (2,123 KB)"
"101","Electron-correlated study of excited states and absorption spectra of some low-symmetry graphene quantum dots","Samayita Das, Alok Shukla","Chemical Physics (physics.chem-ph)","We have computed the linear optical absorption spectra of three graphene quantum dots (GQDs), saturated by hydrogens on the edges, using both first-principles time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) and the Pariser-Parr-Pople (PPP) model coupled with the configuration-interaction (CI) approach. To understand the influence of electron-correlation effects, we have also calculated the singlet-triplet energy gap (spin gap) of the three GQDs. Because of the presence of edge hydrogens, these GQDs are effectively polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) dibenzo[bc,ef]coronene (also known as benzo(1,14)bisanthene, C$_{30}$H$_{14}$), and two isomeric compounds, dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8klm]coronene and dinaphtho[8,1,2abc;2,1,8jkl]coronene with the chemical formula C$_{36}$H$_{16}$. The two isomers have different point group symmetries, $C_{2v}$, and $C_{2h}$, therefore, this study will also help us understand the influence of symmetry on optical properties. A common feature of the absorption spectra of the three GQDs is that the first peak representing the optical gap is of low to moderate intensity, while the intense peaks appear at higher energies. For each GQD, PPP model calculations performed with the screened parameters agree well with the experimental results of the corresponding PAH, and also with the TDDFT calculations.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 16:24:49 UTC (1,036 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 13:38:13 UTC (1,036 KB)"

It reproduces precisely the deviations from the mean-time that were found to be statistically very similar in several environments. The model is based on geometric graphs built from points of a Levy walk. It has a single parameter, the Levy index, that is found to be $\alpha\simeq1.1$ on all the datasets. In this model, the duration of contacts in face to face interactions, which corresponds to the length of discussions for humans, is related to the size of the connected components (clusters) of the Levy graph. We compute analytically the distribution of the clusters size which is of stretched-exponential type and reveals the dynamics of the process. A discussion starts about a topic that is first developed, which, in the Levy framework is described by a geometric distribution. It is then driven by a preferential attachment mechanism; the more a discussion lasts, the more it is likely to continue since there are more points to come back to. This leads to heavy tails in the contact duration. The combined behavior is well captured by the formation of clusters in Levy graphs. We show it has some similarities with the case of a growing network with a sub-linear power-law kernel. More precisely, in this model discussions appear as an aggregation process with a natural scale fixed by the mean interaction time between the individuals.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 10:26:36 UTC (1,082 KB)"

In this work, we use several IBM devices to explore a finite-size spin model with multiple `phase-like' regions characterized by distinct ground-state configurations. Using pre-optimized VQE solutions, we demonstrate that in contrast to calculating the energy, where zero-noise extrapolation is required in order to obtain qualitatively accurate yet still unreliable results, calculations of the energy derivative, two-site spin correlation functions, and the fidelity susceptibility yield accurate behavior across multiple regions, even with minimal or no application of error-mitigation approaches. Taken together, these sets of observables could be used to identify level crossings in VQE solutions in a simple and noise-robust manner, with potential near-term application to identifying quantum phase transitions, avoided crossings and non-adiabatic conical intersections in electronic structure calculations.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:34:11 UTC (1,501 KB)"

Such miniaturized spectrometers are usually based on engineered spectral response units and then reconstruct unknown spectra with algorithms. However, due to the limited footprints of computational on-chip spectrometers, the recovered spectral resolution is limited by the number of integrated spectral response units/filters. Thus, it is challenging to improve the spectral resolution without increasing the number of used filters. Here we present a computational on-chip spectrometer using electrochromic filters that can be electrochemically modulated to increase the efficient sampling number for higher spectral resolution. These filters are directly integrated on top of the photodetector pixels, and the spectral modulation of the filters results from redox reactions during the dual injection of ions and electrons into the electrochromic material. We experimentally demonstrate that the spectral resolution of the proposed spectrometer can be effectively improved as the number of applied voltages increases. The average difference of the peak wavelengths between the reconstructed and the reference spectra decreases from 14.48 nm to 2.57 nm. We also demonstrate the proposed spectrometer can be worked with only four or two filter units, assisted by electrochromic modulation. This strategy suggests a new way to enhance the performance of miniaturized spectrometers with tunable spectral filters for high resolution, low-cost, and portable spectral sensing, and would also inspire the exploration of other stimulus responses such as photochromic and force-chromic, etc, on computational spectrometers.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 08:03:04 UTC (2,308 KB)"

Arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveforms provide continuous pressure measurements throughout the cardiac cycle and offer valuable diagnostic insights. Consequently, there is a significant demand for non-invasive and cuff-less methods to measure ABP waveforms continuously. Accurate prediction of ABP waveforms can also improve the estimation of mean blood pressure, an essential cardiovascular health characteristic. This study proposes a novel framework based on the physics-informed DeepONet approach to predict ABP waveforms. Unlike previous methods, our approach requires the predicted ABP waveforms to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation with a time-periodic condition and a Windkessel boundary condition. Notably, our framework is the first to predict ABP waveforms continuously, both with location and time, within the part of the artery that is being simulated. Furthermore, our method only requires ground truth data at the outlet boundary and can handle periodic conditions with varying periods. Incorporating the Windkessel boundary condition in our solution allows for generating natural physical reflection waves, which closely resemble measurements observed in real-world cases. Moreover, accurately estimating the hyper-parameters in the Navier-Stokes equation for our simulations poses a significant challenge. To overcome this obstacle, we introduce the concept of meta-learning, enabling the neural networks to learn these parameters during the training process.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 06:11:21 UTC (2,391 KB)"

Meanwhile, as the number of transport equations that need to be solved increases, the computational cost grows more substantially, particularly for those combustion models involving direct coupling of chemistry and flow such as the transported probability density function model. In the current study, an integrated Graphics Processing Unit-Artificial Neural Network (GPU-ANN) framework is introduced to comply with heavy computational costs while maintaining high fidelity. Within this framework, a GPU-based solver is employed to solve partial differential equations and compute thermal and transport properties, and an ANN is utilized to replace the calculation of reaction rates. Large eddy simulations of two swirling flames provide a robust validation, affirming and extending the GPU-ANN approach's applicability to challenging scenarios. The simulation results demonstrate a strong correlation in the macro flame structure and statistical characteristics between the GPU-ANN approach and the traditional Central Processing Unit (CPU)-based solver with DI. This comparison indicates that the GPU-ANN approach is capable of attaining the same degree of precision as the conventional CPU-DI solver, even in more complex scenarios. In addition, the overall speed-up factor for the GPU-ANN approach is over two orders of magnitude. This study establishes the potential groundwork for widespread application of the proposed GPU-ANN approach in combustion simulations, addressing various and complex scenarios based on detailed chemistry, while significantly reducing computational costs.","Thu, 29 Feb 2024 05:11:32 UTC (8,036 KB)"

Coupled-cluster theory combined with complex basis functions is used to describe the transient nature of the core-ionized zinc atom. We also introduce second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory as an alternative method for computing partial Auger decay widths. Scalar-relativistic effects are included in our approach for computing Auger electron energies by means of the spin-free exact two-component one-electron Hamiltonian, while spin-orbit coupling is treated by means of perturbation theory. We center our attention on the K-edge Auger decay of zinc dividing the spectrum into three parts (K-LL, K-LM, and K-MM) according to the shells involved in the decay. The computed Auger spectra are in good agreement with experimental results. The most intense peak is found at an Auger electron energy of 7432 eV, which corresponds to a $^1$D$_2$ final state arising from K-L$_2$L$_3$ transitions. Our results highlight the importance of relativistic effects for describing Auger decay in heavier nuclei.

The approach uses hybrid classical/quantum hardware that is well suited for quantum computers of the current noisy intermediate-scale quantum era. The partial differential equation is initially translated into an optimal control problem with a modular control-to-state operator (ansatz). The objective function and its derivatives required by the optimizer can efficiently be evaluated on a quantum computer by measuring an ancilla qubit, while the optimization procedure employs classical hardware. The focal aspect of the study is the treatment of boundary conditions, which is tailored to the properties of the quantum hardware using a correction technique. For this purpose, the boundary conditions and the discretized terms of the partial differential equation are decomposed into a sequence of unitary operations and subsequently compiled into quantum gates. The accuracy and gate complexity of the approach are assessed for second-order partial differential equations by classically emulating the quantum hardware. The examples include steady and unsteady diffusive transport equations for a scalar property in combination with various Dirichlet, Neumann, or Robin conditions. The results of this flexible approach display a robust behavior and a strong predictive accuracy in combination with a remarkable polylog complexity scaling in the number of qubits of the involved quantum circuits.

As fully-resolved climate simulations remain computationally intractable, policy makers must rely on coarse-models to quantify risk for extremes. However, coarse models suffer from inherent bias due to the ignored ""sub-grid"" scales. We propose a framework to non-intrusively debias coarse-resolution climate predictions using neural-network (NN) correction operators. Previous efforts have attempted to train such operators using loss functions that match statistics. However, this approach falls short with events that have longer return period than that of the training data, since the reference statistics have not converged. Here, the scope is to formulate a learning method that allows for correction of dynamics and quantification of extreme events with longer return period than the training data. The key obstacle is the chaotic nature of the underlying dynamics. To overcome this challenge, we introduce a dynamical systems approach where the correction operator is trained using reference data and a coarse model simulation nudged towards that reference. The method is demonstrated on debiasing an under-resolved quasi-geostrophic model and the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM). For the former, our method enables the quantification of events that have return period two orders longer than the training data. For the latter, when trained on 8 years of ERA5 data, our approach is able to correct the coarse E3SM output to closely reflect the 36-year ERA5 statistics for all prognostic variables and significantly reduce their spatial biases.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 17:06:19 UTC (14,899 KB)"

"124","Estimation of railway vehicle response for track geometry evaluation using branch Fourier neural operator","Qingjing Wang, Wenhao Ding, Qing He, Ping Wang","Applied Physics (physics.app-ph)","In railway transportation, the evaluation of track geometry is an indispensable requirement to ensure the safety and comfort of railway vehicles. A promising approach is to directly use vehicle dynamic responses to assess the impact of track geometry defects. However, the computational cost of obtaining the dynamic response of the vehicle body using dynamics simulation methods is large. Thus, it is important to obtain the dynamic response of the vehicle-track coupled system efficiently and accurately. In this work, a branch Fourier neural operator (BFNO) model is proposed to obtain the dynamic response of the vehicle-track coupled system. The model takes into account the nonlinear relationship of the vehicle-track coupled system and realizes the fast and accurate estimation of the system dynamic response. The relative loss (rLSE) of BFNO model is 2.04%, which is reduced by 64%, compared with the traditional neural network (CNN-GRU). In the frequency domain, BFNO model achieves the effective estimation of the dynamic response of the system within the primary frequency range. Compared with the existing methods, our proposed model can make predictions at unseen time steps, enabling predictions from low to high time resolutions. Meanwhile, our proposed model is superior to commercial software in terms of efficiency. In the evaluation of track geometry, users can use pre-trained BFNO to obtain the dynamic response with almost no computational cost.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:38:04 UTC (3,521 KB)"
"125","SuperdropNet: a Stable and Accurate Machine Learning Proxy for Droplet-based Cloud Microphysics","Shivani Sharma, David Greenberg","Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics (physics.ao-ph)","Cloud microphysics has important consequences for climate and weather phenomena, and inaccurate representations can limit forecast accuracy. While atmospheric models increasingly resolve storms and clouds, the accuracy of the underlying microphysics remains limited by computationally expedient bulk moment schemes based on simplifying assumptions. Droplet-based Lagrangian schemes are more accurate but are underutilized due to their large computational overhead. Machine learning (ML) based schemes can bridge this gap by learning from vast droplet-based simulation datasets, but have so far struggled to match the accuracy and stability of bulk moment schemes. To address this challenge, we developed SuperdropNet, an ML-based emulator of the Lagrangian superdroplet simulations. To improve accuracy and stability, we employ multi-step autoregressive prediction during training, impose physical constraints, and carefully control stochasticity in the training data. Superdropnet predicted hydrometeor states and cloud-to-rain transition times more accurately than previous ML emulators, and matched or outperformed bulk moment schemes in many cases. We further carried out detailed analyses to reveal how multistep autoregressive training improves performance, and how the performance of SuperdropNet and other microphysical schemes hydrometeors' mass, number and size distribution. Together our results suggest that ML models can effectively emulate cloud microphysics, in a manner consistent with droplet-based simulations.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 14:26:16 UTC (11,250 KB)"

However, block reconstruction and then stitching has currently become an unavoidable procedure due to vignetting effects. The stitched image tends to present color inconsistency in different image segments, or even stitching artifacts. In response, we reported a computational framework based on feature-domain backdiffraction to realize full-FOV, stitching-free FPM reconstruction. Different from conventional algorithms that establish the loss function in the image domain, our method formulates it in the feature domain, where effective information of images is extracted by a feature extractor to bypass the vignetting effect. The feature-domain error between predicted images based on estimation of model parameters and practically captured images is then digitally diffracted back through the optical system for complex amplitude reconstruction and aberration compensation. Through massive simulations and experiments, the method presents effective elimination of vignetting artifacts, and reduces the requirement of precise knowledge of illumination positions. We also found its great potential to recover the data with a lower overlapping rate of spectrum and to realize automatic blind-digital refocusing without a prior defocus distance.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 11:59:12 UTC (36,120 KB)"

In this work, we consider the problem of constructing graphs with a prescribed set of discrete edge curvatures, and explore the space of such graphs. We address this problem in two ways: first, we develop an evolutionary algorithm to sample graphs with discrete curvatures close to a given set. We use this algorithm to explore how other network statistics vary when constrained by the discrete curvatures in the network. Second, we solve the exact reconstruction problem for the specific case of Forman-Ricci curvature. By leveraging the theory of Markov bases, we obtain a finite set of rewiring moves that connects the space of all graphs with a fixed discrete curvature.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 09:48:24 UTC (4,388 KB)"

Forms CE1 and CE2 are both written in density, momentum, and specific enthalpy, but employ two different treatments of the buoyancy and pressure gradient terms: for CE1 it is the standard pressure splitting implemented in open-source finite volume solvers (e.g., OpenFOAM), while for CE2 it is the typical pressure splitting found in computational atmospheric studies. Form CE3 is written in density, momentum, and potential temperature, with the buoyancy and pressure terms addressed as in CE2. For each formulation, we adopt a computationally efficient splitting approach. The three formulations are thoroughly assessed and compared through six benchmark tests involving dry air flow over a flat terrain or orography. We found that all three models are able to provide accurate results for the tests with a flat terrain, although the solvers based on the CE2 and CE3 forms are more robust. As for the mountain tests, CE1 solutions become unstable, while the CE2 and CE3 models provide results in very good agreement with data in the literature, the CE3 model being the most accurate. Hence, the CE3 model is the most accurate, reliable, and robust for the simulation of mesoscale atmospheric flows when using a pressure-based approach and space discretization by a finite volume method.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 07:56:58 UTC (10,549 KB)"

Setting up computational models however becomes increasingly challenging as systems grow in size and complexity. Especially the consistent combination of models across different physical domains usually demands a lot of attention. This motivates us to study formal languages for compositional modeling of multiphysical systems. This article shows how multibody systems, or more precisely assemblies of rigid bodies connected by lower kinematic pairs, fit into the framework of Exergetic Port-Hamiltonian Systems (EPHS). This approach is based on the hierarchical decomposition of systems into their ultimately primitive components, using a simple graphical syntax. Thereby, cognitive load can be reduced and communication is facilitated, even with non-experts. Moreover, the encapsulation and reuse of subsystems promotes efficient model development and management. In contrast to established modeling languages such as Modelica, the primitive components of EPHS are not defined by arbitrary equations. Instead, there are four kinds of components, each defined by a particular geometric structure with a clear physical interpretation. This higher-level approach could make the process of building and maintaining large-scale models simpler and also safer.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 06:34:01 UTC (130 KB)"

In this study, we used a GPU-accelerated quantum simulator (cuQuantum) to perform the electron correlation part of the FMO calculation as a unitary coupled-cluster singles and doubles (UCCSD) with the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), using hydrogen-bonded systems (FH)$_3$ and (FH)$_2$-H$_2$O as testbeds. From the numerical simulations, we found that the Trotter decomposition of the UCCSD ansatz breaks the orbital-invariance condition, and it can yield different total energies for symmetrically equivalent molecules. We also observed that the Trotterized UCCSD does not satisfy the size-consistency, which is an essential requirement in the FMO scheme, when the molecular orbitals delocalized to dimers are used.

The existing data-driven strategies show potential limitations to the model robustness and interpretability as well as the dependency of rich data. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel physics-informed machine learning (PiML) method, which incorporates scientific principles and physical laws into deep neural networks for modeling seismic responses of nonlinear structures. The basic concept is to constrain the solution space of the ML model within known physical bounds. This is made possible with three main features, namely, model order reduction, a long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, and Newton's second law (e.g., the equation of motion). Model order reduction is essential for handling structural systems with inherent redundancy and enhancing model efficiency. The LSTM network captures temporal dependencies, enabling accurate prediction of time series responses. The equation of motion is manipulated to learn system nonlinearities and confines the solution space within physically interpretable results. These features enable model training with relatively sparse data and offer benefits in terms of accuracy, interpretability, and robustness. Furthermore, a dataset of seismically designed archetype ductile planar steel moment resistant frames under horizontal seismic loading, available in the DesignSafe-CI Database, is considered for evaluation of the proposed method. The resulting metamodel is capable of handling more complex data compared to existing physics-guided LSTM models and outperforms other non-physics data-driven neural networks.","Wed, 28 Feb 2024 02:16:03 UTC (3,604 KB)[v2] Fri, 1 Mar 2024 14:09:44 UTC (3,603 KB)"

However, physicists performing data analyses are usually required to steer their individual, complex workflows manually, frequently involving job submission in several stages and interaction with distributed storage systems by hand. This process is not only time-consuming and error-prone, but also leads to undocumented relations between particular workloads, rendering the steering of an analysis a serious challenge. This article presents the Luigi Analysis Workflow (Law) Python package which is based on the open-source pipelining tool Luigi, originally developed by Spotify. It establishes a generic design pattern for analyses of arbitrary scale and complexity, and shifts the focus from executing to defining the analysis logic. Law provides the building blocks to seamlessly integrate with interchangeable remote resources without, however, limiting itself to a specific choice of infrastructure. In particular, it introduces the concept of complete separation between analysis algorithms on the one hand, and run locations, storage locations, and software environments on the other hand. To cope with the sophisticated demands of end-to-end HEP analyses, Law supports job execution on WLCG infrastructure (ARC, gLite, CMS-CRAB) as well as on local computing clusters (HTCondor, Slurm, LSF), remote file access via various protocols using the Grid File Access Library (GFAL2), and an environment sandboxing mechanism with support for sub-shells and virtual environments, as well as Docker and Singularity containers. Moreover, the novel approach ultimately aims for analysis preservation out-of-the-box.

Traditional methods for predicting buffet onset rely on multiple computational fluid dynamics simulations to assess a series of airfoil flowfields and then apply criteria to them, which is slow and hinders optimization efforts. This article introduces an innovative approach for rapid buffet onset prediction. A machine-learning flowfield prediction model is pre-trained on a large database and then deployed offline to replace simulations in the buffet prediction process for new airfoil designs. Unlike using a model to directly predict buffet onset, the proposed technique offers better visualization capabilities by providing users with intuitive flowfield outputs. It also demonstrates superior generalization ability, evidenced by a 32.5% reduction in average buffet onset prediction error on the testing dataset. The method is utilized to optimize the buffet performance of 11 distinct airfoils within and outside the training dataset. The optimization results are verified with simulations and proved to yield improved samples across all cases. It is affirmed the pre-trained flowfield prediction model can be applied to accelerate aerodynamic shape optimization, while further work still needs to raise its reliability for this safety-critical task.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 23:37:11 UTC (2,651 KB)"

At the core of this method, a kernel function is employed to calculate the distance between different elements of the dataset, allowing for their classification. Since every kernel function can be expressed as a scalar product, we can estimate it using Quantum Mechanics, where probability amplitudes and scalar products are fundamental objects. The swap test, indeed, is a quantum algorithm capable of computing the scalar product of two arbitrary wavefunctions, potentially enabling a quantum speed-up. Here, we present an integrated photonic circuit designed to implement the swap test algorithm. Our approach relies solely on linear optical integrated components and qudits, represented by single photons from an attenuated laser beam propagating through a set of waveguides. By utilizing 2$^3$ spatial degrees of freedom for the qudits, we can configure all the necessary arrangements to set any two-qubits state and perform the swap test. This simplifies the requirements on the circuitry elements and eliminates the need for non-linearity, heralding, or post-selection to achieve multi-qubits gates. Our photonic swap test circuit successfully encodes two qubits and estimates their scalar product with a measured root mean square error smaller than 0.05. This result paves the way for the development of integrated photonic architectures capable of performing Quantum Machine Learning tasks with robust devices operating at room temperature.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 22:34:14 UTC (4,210 KB)"

To address this critical need, we designed a paper-based multiplexed vertical flow assay (xVFA) using five structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2, detecting IgG and IgM antibodies to monitor changes in COVID-19 immunity levels. Our platform not only tracked longitudinal immunity levels but also categorized COVID-19 immunity into three groups: protected, unprotected, and infected, based on the levels of IgG and IgM antibodies.

A far more compact alternative is to avoid explicitly defining any components and instead sculpt the continuous substrate of the photonic processor to directly perform the computation using waves freely propagating in two dimensions. We propose and demonstrate a device whose refractive index as a function of space, $n(x,z)$, can be rapidly reprogrammed, allowing arbitrary control over the wave propagation in the device. Our device, a 2D-programmable waveguide, combines photoconductive gain with the electro-optic effect to achieve massively parallel modulation of the refractive index of a slab waveguide, with an index modulation depth of $10^{-3}$ and approximately $10^4$ programmable degrees of freedom. We used a prototype device with a functional area of $12\,\text{mm}^2$ to perform neural-network inference with up to 49-dimensional input vectors in a single pass, achieving 96% accuracy on vowel classification and 86% accuracy on $7 \times 7$-pixel MNIST handwritten-digit classification. This is a scale beyond that of previous photonic chips relying on discrete components, illustrating the benefit of the continuous-waves paradigm.

Advancements in the optical data acquisition setup, exemplified by in-situ CDI, have shown potential for low-dose imaging. But these depend on a time series of measurements, rendering them unsuitable for single-image applications. Similarly, on the computational front, data-driven phase retrieval techniques are not readily adaptable to the single-image context.

In the presence of discontinuities, such as shocks, spectral approximations develop Gibbs oscillations near the discontinuity. This causes the numerical solution to deviate quickly from the true solution. For spectral approximations of the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, nonlinear wave resonances lead to the formation of tygers in well-resolved areas of the flow, far from the shock. Recently, Besse(to be published) has proposed novel spectral relaxation (SR) and spectral purging (SP) schemes for the removal of tygers and Gibbs oscillations in spectral approximations of nonlinear conservation laws. For the 1D inviscid Burgers equation, it is shown that the novel SR and SP approximations of the solution converge strongly in L2 norm to the entropic weak solution, under an appropriate choice of kernels and related parameters. In this work, we carry out a detailed numerical investigation of SR and SP schemes when applied to the 1D inviscid Burgers equation and report the efficiency of shock capture and the removal of tygers. We then extend our study to systems of nonlinear hyperbolic conservation laws - such as the 2x2 system of the shallow water equations and the standard 3x3 system of 1D compressible Euler equations. For the latter, we generalise the implementation of SR methods to non-periodic problems using Chebyshev polynomials. We then turn to singular flow in the 1D wall approximation of the 3D-axisymmetric wall-bounded incompressible Euler equation. Here, in order to determine the blowup time of the solution, we compare the decay of the width of the analyticity strip, obtained from the pure pseudospectral method, with the improved estimate obtained using the novel spectral relaxation scheme.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 17:05:06 UTC (15,800 KB)[v2] Wed, 28 Feb 2024 21:54:25 UTC (15,808 KB)"

We demonstrate the framework to an optical microdisk cavity and derive a semi-analytical solution to validate the numerical results. The computed eigenfrequency sensitivities are used to track the exceptional point along an exceptional surface in the parameter space. The presented framework can be applied to any kind of resonance problem, e.g., with arbitrary geometry or with exceptional points of arbitrary order.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 16:18:40 UTC (1,156 KB)"
"146","Thermodynamics-informed super-resolution of scarce temporal dynamics data","Carlos Bermejo-Barbanoj, Beatriz Moya, Alberto Badías, Francisco Chinesta, Elías Cueto","Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph)","We present a method to increase the resolution of measurements of a physical system and subsequently predict its time evolution using thermodynamics-aware neural networks. Our method uses adversarial autoencoders, which reduce the dimensionality of the full order model to a set of latent variables that are enforced to match a prior, for example a normal distribution. Adversarial autoencoders are seen as generative models, and they can be trained to generate high-resolution samples from low-resoution inputs, meaning they can address the so-called super-resolution problem. Then, a second neural network is trained to learn the physical structure of the latent variables and predict their temporal evolution. This neural network is known as an structure-preserving neural network. It learns the metriplectic-structure of the system and applies a physical bias to ensure that the first and second principles of thermodynamics are fulfilled. The integrated trajectories are decoded to their original dimensionality, as well as to the higher dimensionality space produced by the adversarial autoencoder and they are compared to the ground truth solution. The method is tested with two examples of flow over a cylinder, where the fluid properties are varied between both examples.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:46:45 UTC (3,624 KB)"
"147","Collisional excitation of propyne (CH$_3$CCH) by He atoms","M. Ben Khalifa, B. Darna, J. Loreau","Astrophysics of Galaxies (astro-ph.GA)","A detailed interpretation of the detected emission lines of environments in which propyne (or methyl acetylene, CH$_3$CCH) is observed requires a knowledge of its collisional rate coefficients with the most abundant species in the interstellar medium, He or H$_2$. We present the first three-dimensional potential energy surface (3D-PES) for the CH$_3$CCH-He molecular complex, study the dynamics of the collision, and report the first set of rate coefficients for temperatures up to 100 K for the collisional excitation of the lowest 60 ortho rotational levels and 60 para rotational levels of CH$_3$CCH by He atoms. We computed the 3D-PES with the explicitly correlated coupled-cluster with single-, double-, and perturbative triple-excitation method, in conjunction with the augmented correlation-consistent triple zeta basis set (CCSD(T)-F12a/aug-cc-pVTZ). The 3D-PES was fitted to an analytical function. Scattering computations of pure rotational (de-)excitation of CH$_3$CCH by collision with He atoms were performed and the state-to-state cross sections were computed using the close coupling method for total energies up to 100 cm$^{-1}$ and with the coupled states approximation at higher energy for both ortho and para symmetries of CH$_3$CCH. The PES obtained is caracterized by a large anisotropy and a potential well depth of 51.04 cm$^{-1}$. By thermally averaging the collisional cross sections, we determined quenching rate coefficients for kinetic temperatures up to 100 K. A strong even $\Delta j$ propensity rule at almost all collision energies exists for CH$_3$CCH-He complex. To evaluate the impact of rate coefficients in the analysis of observations, we carried out non-LTE radiative transfer computations of the excitation temperatures and we demonstrate that LTE conditions are typically not fulfilled for the propyne molecule.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 13:17:19 UTC (550 KB)"
"148","Equilibria and Dynamics of two coupled chains of interacting dipoles","Manuel Iñarrea, J.Pablo Salas, R.González-Férez, P.Schmelcher","Atomic and Molecular Clusters (physics.atm-clus)","We explore the energy transfer dynamics in an array of two chains of identical rigid interacting dipoles. A crossover between two different ground state (GS) equilibrium configurations is observed with varying distance between the two chains of the array. Linearizing around the GS configurations, we verify that interactions up to third nearest neighbors should be accounted for accurately describe the resulting dynamics. Starting with one of the GS, we excite the system by supplying it with an excess energy DK located initially on one of the dipoles. We study the time evolution of the array for different values of the system parameters b and DK. Our focus is hereby on two features of the energy propagation: the redistribution of the excess energy DK among the two chains and the energy localization along each chain. For typical parameter values, the array of dipoles reaches both the equipartition between the chains and the thermal equilibrium from the early stages of the time evolution. Nevertheless, there is a region in parameter space (b,DK) where even up to the long computation time of this study, the array does neither reach energy equipartition nor thermalization between chains. This fact is due to the existence of persistent chaotic breathers.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:53:02 UTC (5,670 KB)"
"149","Segment anything model for head and neck tumor segmentation with CT, PET and MRI multi-modality images","Jintao Ren, Mathis Rasmussen, Jasper Nijkamp, Jesper Grau Eriksen, Stine Korreman","Medical Physics (physics.med-ph)","Deep learning presents novel opportunities for the auto-segmentation of gross tumor volume (GTV) in head and neck cancer (HNC), yet fully automatic methods usually necessitate significant manual refinement. This study investigates the Segment Anything Model (SAM), recognized for requiring minimal human prompting and its zero-shot generalization ability across natural images. We specifically examine MedSAM, a version of SAM fine-tuned with large-scale public medical images. Despite its progress, the integration of multi-modality images (CT, PET, MRI) for effective GTV delineation remains a challenge. Focusing on SAM's application in HNC GTV segmentation, we assess its performance in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios using single (CT-only) and fused multi-modality images. Our study demonstrates that fine-tuning SAM significantly enhances its segmentation accuracy, building upon the already effective zero-shot results achieved with bounding box prompts. These findings open a promising avenue for semi-automatic HNC GTV segmentation.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 12:26:45 UTC (1,062 KB)"
"150","A novel image space formalism of Fourier domain interpolation neural networks for noise propagation analysis","Peter Dawood, Felix Breuer, Istvan Homolya, Jannik Stebani, Maximilian Gram, Peter M. Jakob, Moritz Zaiss, Martin Blaimer","Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV)","Purpose: To develop an image space formalism of multi-layer convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for Fourier domain interpolation in MRI reconstructions and analytically estimate noise propagation during CNN inference. Theory and Methods: Nonlinear activations in the Fourier domain (also known as k-space) using complex-valued Rectifier Linear Units are expressed as elementwise multiplication with activation masks. This operation is transformed into a convolution in the image space. After network training in k-space, this approach provides an algebraic expression for the derivative of the reconstructed image with respect to the aliased coil images, which serve as the input tensors to the network in the image space. This allows the variance in the network inference to be estimated analytically and to be used to describe noise characteristics. Monte-Carlo simulations and numerical approaches based on auto-differentiation were used for validation. The framework was tested on retrospectively undersampled invivo brain images. Results: Inferences conducted in the image domain are quasi-identical to inferences in the k-space, underlined by corresponding quantitative metrics. Noise variance maps obtained from the analytical expression correspond with those obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations, as well as via an auto-differentiation approach. The noise resilience is well characterized, as in the case of classical Parallel Imaging. Komolgorov-Smirnov tests demonstrate Gaussian distributions of voxel magnitudes in variance maps obtained via Monte-Carlo simulations. Conclusion: The quasi-equivalent image space formalism for neural networks for k-space interpolation enables fast and accurate description of the noise characteristics during CNN inference, analogous to geometry-factor maps in traditional parallel imaging methods.","Tue, 27 Feb 2024 11:01:58 UTC (1,871 KB)"
