"1","Saltburn","M_Exchange","30 November 2023","6/10","Its third act requires a HUGE suspension of disbelief","Yes, its derivative, and yes, if you have even moderate familiarity with movies from the last few decades you will think The Talented Mr. Ripley fairly early during its runtime. However, for the most part, I enjoyed it. Barry Keoghan never disappoints me. Whether he is playing a suicidal dullard in The Banshees of Inisherin or a psychotic mastermind in this movie (and many other roles in between), he is always brilliant.For me, unfortunately its third act is probably its most memorable feature because it requires an enormous suspension of disbelief. Rosamunds Elspeth character invites Keoghans Oliver character into her home yet again even though his history there is unbelievably dubious. She claimed that she felt guilty about his exile, but one wonders about her motives. Was she trying to have sex with him at that point? Rosamund Pike is an ageless, gorgeous woman, and her character had endless wealth she didnt need an averagelooking poor guy in her life. Also, why did she sign away her fortune to him so quickly? Was she not suspicious about her sudden illness with him in her life again? The butler, who observes everything obsessively, remained a presence there. Even if Elspeth took leave of her senses, wouldnt he intercede? The third act defies any sort of logic.But again, it was worth watching."
"2","Saltburn","mjw2305","8 January 2024","3/10","Pretentious garbage!","There is a lot of hype about this movie, and a lot of talk about how some of the scenes are not for the feint hearted and that it is full of twists and turns. I was lured in for all the wrong reasons and knew very little else about Saltburn when I sat down to watch it.My score of 3 is entirely for the cast. I cant fault any of them. Sadly that is only positive I can draw from this awful film.The twists - I saw all of them coming, most are heavily contrived, and none felt shocking in the slightest.The not for the feint hearted stuff - Sucking ejaculate from a draining bath plug, eating menstrual blood, having sex with a recently filled grave! It is all gratuitous and for shock value only. Yet, without these scenes there is literally nothing else going on.Saltburn is a seriously dull watch, the humour is barely present at all. I would have turned off after about an hour, but having got that far I stayed in hope of a clever ending. Nothing clever here, in fact, rather than clever they went for nonsensical. As if no one would suspect that the new guy would be behind all the deaths so he could get his hands on the estate.Boring journey, weak plot, dull twists, and gratuitous scenes do not make for a good watch.3/10 for the cast 0/10 for the film."
"3","Phantom Thread","AlsExGal","18 December 2019","9/10","A most unusual romance","In early 1950s Britain, Reynolds Woodcock (Daniel Day-Lewis) is the most sought-after dress designer among the rich and powerful. He lives a regimented, almost monastic life, with his watchful sister Cyril (Lesley Manville) as his close associate. One day Reynolds meets waitress Alma (Vicky Krieps) and takes her on as his muse, model, lover, whatever he needs. Alma learns that shes not the first to fill this position in Reynolds life, but she becomes determined to be the last.I could care less about the fashion world or Haute Couture, and yet I still was drawn into the single-minded obsessive artistry of Reynolds world, his strict discipline and pursuit of perfection within his chosen field. Alma acts as an audience surrogate, unsure of this odd world led by the often inscrutable Reynolds and Cyril, the latter of whom often has the charm of an asp. But as Alma begins to see the way things work in this cloistered, rarefied world, she begins to find ways to upset it and bend it to her advantage. Cyril is naturally distrusting of this latest distraction, but Reynolds seems to find something in this new, shaky lifestyle of uncertainty.The performances are fantastic, with Day-Lewis once laying claim to the title of greatest actor of his generation. He complex, unique yet very real, without a single false note. Manville was also singled out for awards consideration, and shes scary, pitiful, powerful, and voice for order and tradition. Vicky Krieps, a native of Luxembourg, is subtle, sharp, and a match for Day-Lewis as the seemingly simple, unworldly Alma.The filmmaking is concise and largely unobtrusive, letting the characters do the work, often with silent looks and facial expressions. Director Anderson did not use a Director of Photography on this, instead working with the camera operators themselves. The result is spontaneous but not amateur looking, with a slight gritty haze that makes many scenes almost dream-like. Its not a look that I would like to see in a lot of films, but it works here among the chilly environments both exterior and interior. The score by Jonny Greenwood, guitarist and songwriter from Radiohead, is surprisingly subdued, mainly light piano pieces, with some flourishes when needed.I wont pretend that a lot of viewers will like this, as they might find it slow, pretentious, boring, or pointless. I certainly did not, and found it a deep, and even deeply disturbing, look at a unique type of love fostered by unusual people, told in a compelling, if quiet, way. This is more for the Masterpiece Theatre crowd than the Fast and the Furious crowd. I would rank this among the very best of the year 2017. Highly Recommended."
"4","Phantom Thread","siderite","18 June 2018","8/10","You will either like it or hate it","This is obviously a carefully crafted film: from the scenes, the acting, the words, the clothes, the facial and body movements, the music, it is all careful and artistic. That being said, it is terribly descriptive: an obsessive dress maker finds his muse in a strange woman who wants him to be hers alone. There is nothing else, just their play back and forth, and then the film ends. If you are here for the quality of film making, then you will probably like the film. If you want some insight into human psyche, this is a good film to learn from, with actors as dedicated as Lewis, Manville and Krieps. If you are looking for an interesting story that fills you with emotion and teaches you new things, you may be disappointed.It doesnt help that neither of the characters in this film is even remotely relatable. Lewis character is the typical obsessive genius that is careless of others and focuses on his work above all else. Yet he is not that much of a genius, just a failed human being with some temporary success and weird fetishes. Manvilles character is a stern woman whos only purpose in life seems to care for Lewis to the point of losing herself, to keep things in balance when his histrionics threaten the house. Krieps character is plain creepy. If you want something to make you fear women, this is a great start. She is concomitantly lovely and well intentioned and borderline psychotic.Bottom line: a very technical and artistic study on a rather boring subject and some unrelatable people."
"5","Puss in Boots","benjaminskylerhill","22 December 2022","10/10","Yeah, its that good.","But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and its almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didnt expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think its Dreamworks best film since Megamind and its easily the best true family film of the year."
"6","Puss in Boots","GusherPop","22 December 2022","10/10","Darker, Better and Brings my childhood back","Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the Shrek universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. Hes a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but hes also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figures suave and silly sides. The Last Wish expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original Puss in Boots. Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, DaVine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercados film. The films aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss whiskers blowing in the wind, The Last Wish offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesnt feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you wont need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you."
"7","The Meg","imseeg","5 August 2018","9/10","There is an air of quiet death in this house and I dont like the smell of it","P.T. Andersons movies are best suited for the arthouse movie lovers. For those who love to be puzzled and confused. For those who like to use their brain while watching a movie and who can relate to mentally twisted emotions, which wont fare well with those who might wish for an upbeat kind of story. No cheery happy feelings to be found here. Oh no!Beware, the first half of this story is rather bland, but that slowburning start is only the introduction to a mesmirising second half of this movie, with a grand final to follow! The ending is truly heavenly. I dont have any other words for it. Mind you, I am not at all a romantic person, but this movie mesmirized me romantically with its dark beauty. It is almost superfluous to state the following, but the photography, editing and soundtrack are magnificent, as always.I can understand why this masterpiece has earned 50 movie awards worldwide, but at first I had my doubts though about this latest story in. Beforehand I had only heard that it was about a tailor in England. I just couldnt imagine how anything remotely dramatic could be extracted from an ordinary story about a tailor. But stories by P.T. Anderson are NEVER what they seem to be at first sight. But even while watching it I could not surpress my anxiety that this movie might be the first one in his carreer that was rather bland, without any big drama. I was proven wrong ofcourse. The climax in is only to be found near the very end. And then it feels like emotional fireworks going off!"

"9","Schlinders List","Gordon-11","19 October 2009","10/10","A three hour film that feels too short","This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch Schindlers List for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I dont want to be disappointed. Schindlers List is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindlers List. The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but Schindlers List is a three hour film that feels too short."
"10","Schlinders List","ebiros2","17 October 2005","10/10","Awesome","The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who wont go along with the cruelty of society. Im sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and youll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldnt be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think hell be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindlers last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."
